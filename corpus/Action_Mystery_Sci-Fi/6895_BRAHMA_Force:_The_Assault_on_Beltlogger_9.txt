A mech-based FPS; pilot your Bipedal Robotic Assault Heavy Mechanized Armor (built by Bronx Industries, of course) through the Beltlogger 9 excavation colony - and discover what happened to the Beltlogger 9 colony. It may be related to the events on Probe Ship Mina 3, wherein a lone person apparently under the control of an outside intelligence slaughtered his shipmates.
