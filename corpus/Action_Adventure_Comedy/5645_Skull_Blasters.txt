Restored from VHS-CD and modified to be played or watched on any supported browser, the emotional tale of one man's fight against a dominant villain will finally be told. Players take control of a nameless mute, summoned by the legendary hero "Macho Man" to aid in his quest to stop the evil forces of "Skull Guy", ranging from sneaky werewolves to chainsaw demons from the pits of hell itself.
