The story follows that of the film very closely. In a faraway kingdom, a king sought a cure for his wife's life-threatening ailment. After hearing of a magical flower that could cure everything, he ordered a broth made of the flower, and his wife was immediately cured. The trade-off was that their newborn daughter had long, flowing blonde hair that possessed its own healing powers. Hearing of this discovery, an evil witch kidnapped the infant princess, locked her away in a tower, raised her as her own child and warned her of the horrors of the outside world. Years later, a bandit by the name of Flynn Rider came upon the tower and found himself knocked out by the now-teenage princess named Rapunzel. After agreeing to hide his stolen stash, she made a deal with the bandit: The stash would be returned only if he agreed to show her the kingdom where flying lanterns were released every night on her birthday.
