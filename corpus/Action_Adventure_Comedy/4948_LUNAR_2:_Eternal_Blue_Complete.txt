You control Hiro, a young treasure hunter who likes exploring various caves and ruins with his trusty companion, the wise-cracking pink flying cat Ruby (who claims to be a baby dragon). One day he meets a mysterious blue-haired girl named Lucia. She explains that she has come from the nearby Blue Star and now needs his help in order to defeat a dark being called Zophar. Bewitched by the girl's beauty, Hiro agrees to help Lucia, and soon finds himself opposing the ruling religion of the world, and shadows from the past.
