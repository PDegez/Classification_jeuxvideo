Prince Laharl has now become the Overlord of his own Netherworld, but is lacking charisma to gather many vassals and be recognized as such. The Krichevskoy Group, a gathering of Laharl's late father's former vassals opposes Laharl's Overlordship. When Yuie, flowers native to the angel's realm Celestia start appearing in Laharl's Netherworld, strange events affecting demons start occuring: Etna changes colors and now look like she is "Player 2", the early bird Flonne starts oversleeping, and Laharl himself wakes up as a woman. Only the angel Sicily, who claims to be Laharl's sister, is unaffected. The Krichevskoy Group blames Laharl for the appearance of the Yuie flowers and those incidents.
