When human civilization reached its apex and expanded to outer space, a mysterious energy was developed by a scientist named Arthur Tesla. The energy, called Chaotics, defies all current human understanding. When humanity uncovered it's secrets over time, it became the world's most common energy source. At the same time, as the secrets were discovered, Arthur disappears, and he leaves behind two words: Chaos Code. The Earth-Union government, which is thought to have been related to the Chaotics, offers a massive cash prize to anyone who can find the meaning behind the chaos code, even those who want to have the Chaotics energy for themselves or take over the Earth-Union government.
