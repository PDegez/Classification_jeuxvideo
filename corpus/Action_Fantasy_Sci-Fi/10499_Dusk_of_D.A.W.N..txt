In Dusk of DAWN you take on the role as a CEO of your own megacorporation and it is your mission to stay on top of the corporate ladder! So gear up, because it is going to be one hell of a ride. Other corporations will come at you with everything they got and do you really know which one of your own employees you can trust? The game tears down the typical restrictions from which many other lane based CCGs suffer and creates a whole new realm of tactical and strategical opportunities for you to explore. Build your deck out of over 100 cards from four different card types and five different rarities. Use your deck in battles against other corporations in PvE and PvP matches. Your ultimate goal ist to obliterate the opposing corporation. All you have to do is break your opponent's line of defense created by his own cards. So you better come up with a useful combination of attacks, abilities and card synergies. Sounds easy enough, doesn't it?
