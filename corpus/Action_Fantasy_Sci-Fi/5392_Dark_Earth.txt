Dark Earth is set in a post-apocalyptic society in the 21st century shaped by the fact that the Earth no longer receives the sun's rays due to meteor collisions. In a few areas light breaks through the dust clouds, creating oases for human settlements or "stallites" to flourish. The cities of the survivors have regressed to roughly a medieval state of sophistication, strongly determined by religious rituals and routines, although everywhere there are ruins and functional pieces of technology indicating the remains of an equivalent to present-day society. For some reason the darkness mutates humans exposed to it, turning them into bizarre, hostile mutants. Light is worshipped as a godlike being in Dark Earth's stallites, and the priests are the leaders of their communities. The protagonist is Arkhan, a protector of the priests, who is poisoned in a conspiratorial attack and begins to transform into a dark creature. The rest of the game revolves around finding a cure for his mutation and find out why he was attacked in a race against time.
