Unlike the previous games which were fairly standalone, Front Mission 5 covers the time period from 2070 to 2121. In effect, it goes through conflicts seen in the previous games as the years pass by. Through the eyes of U.S.N. soldier/officer Walter Feng, the player experiences his story as he deals with the aforementioned conflicts. With the passing of time, he becomes witness to hidden truths and accounts. Eventually, Feng is drawn to the on-going war on terrorism and begins to search for the truth.
