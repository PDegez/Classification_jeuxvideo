Various organizations are trying to gain power through military assaults, piloting huge robots which are the main means of combat in those days. A war between the USN (United States of the New Continent and the OCU (Oceana Community Union) begins because of the so-called Larcus Incident. Huffman Island, a location with important weapon factories, is infiltrated by USN people under the leadership of commander Driscoll. Driscoll causes an explosion that blows the factory off, and puts the blame on the OCU soldier, Roid. A year later, Roid makes a living with his robot in the arena when he is approached by a mysterious man from the OCU. Embarking across Huffman Island, now controlled by the OCU, Roid receives a mission to investigate the USN forces recently sighted.
