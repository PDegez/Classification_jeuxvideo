Rocky, Colt and Tum Tum jump from their hit sequel into this awesome action game! The boys fight with their weapons of choice: Rocky has a Ninja staff, Colt has Katana blades, and Tum Tum uses Sais. The game starts out with them going through the woods while their Grandpa, Mori Shintaro, tests them. Soon Grandpa is off to Japan and the boys stop three bumbling brain-dead thieves from robbing the cabin. Their names are Glam, Slam and Vinnie. The kids snatch Grandpa's credit card and fly to Japan to help him, while getting pitted against new enemies and help Grandpa defeat Glam, Slam and Vinnie at the hospital. Just push him in the right direction!
