Between the Ashes tells the story of mankind after the Shivans have been defeated and the Lucifer destroyed. The stage is set by the GTI rebellion near the end of the Great War. Without a home, mankind wanders across the stars aimless and without purpose. Where do we go from here? Are the Shivans still out there? Who else might lurk in the universe seeking our destruction and how do we prepare? These are the questions everyone is asking.
