In the distant future, human governments construct a massive supercomputer called "Con-Human". Con-Human was designed to govern Earth's environmental systems as well as verifying nutrients and care to ensure the culture of humans and animals alike. However, after a cloned human is linked with the system, Con-Human becomes sentient and insane, constructing corrupt clones of existing organisms, turning against its creators and eventually overrunning the planet. With 99.8% of mankind exterminated, remnants fled to space colonies as Con-Human has made Earth itself its main body. To prevent the destruction of the space colonies, the RVA-818 X-LAY starfighter is deployed to destroy Con-Human and the infected Earth.
