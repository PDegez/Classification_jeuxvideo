In the year 2042, a companion star from Jupiter appears and propels the asteroids along Jupiter's orbit toward the Earth, causing a series of meteorites. Soon after, aliens known as "Nemesis" begin to invade Earth for its resources, and the military is quickly defeated by the aliens' powerful laser weapons. Earth's scientists began to study the molecules which powered the aliens' weapons, and was named "Newalone". As a result, scientists began Project Metal Black, which involved at least 20000 aircraft possessing the same weaponry as the aliens. The spacecraft armed with the weapons was known as the "CF-345 Black Fly". Ten years after the invasion, however, Earth surrenders to the aliens and promises to keep Earth's forces from attacking. This also applied to Project Metal Black and prevented the use of the Black Fly fighters. The aliens continued to strike anyway, draining Earth of most of its natural resources. Now, a lone pilot has commandeered one of the Black Fly fighters to defeat Nemesis and save what's left of humanity.
