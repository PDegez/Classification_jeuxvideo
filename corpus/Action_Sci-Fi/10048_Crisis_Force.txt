The year is 199X. Asuka and Maya are a pair of siblings living in Tokyo as high school students. Their parents are archaeologists, though they live a mundane life. Suddenly, one day, the nightmare the siblings were dreaming of became a reality, as the seven monsters that sunk the city of Atlantis and destroyed ancient civilizations 10,000 years ago had suddenly revived. Modern weapons were no use against the more powerful weapons of Atlantis, and the whole world was engulfed in war. Eventually, the war had arrived in Japan, and among the victims were Asuka and Maya's parents. In their dying moments, they revealed that they were not Asuka and Maya's true parents, and that 17 years ago in an archaeological trip on a deserted island, they had discovered an Aurawing, an special type of aircraft created by the ancient Mu civilization. Inside the craft, there was a life-support system carrying a pair of infants. It turns out that Asuka and Maya were actually the children of a brave warrior from Mu who had fought against Atlantis 10,000 years ago. Now Asuka and Maya, having awakened to their true destiny, are the only ones who can defeat Atlantis. The two board their respective Aurawing ships as they fly off to a mysterious continent shrouded in dark clouds.
