Ken had no interest in the frontier. Then his partner Troy was killed. Someone broke into their lab, stole their invention, and left Troy as a pile of jelly on the floor. It's been 25 years since Ken was king of the Street Fighter circuit but that's nothing some good bionics can't fix. Fortunately, the killer's path is pretty easy to trace. Every frontier world the killer visited became quickly infested by Ken and Troy's remarkable Cyboplasm. In small doses, it can give people the extra strength they need to remain alive. In large doses, it comes alive and takes over the body of its host, turning them into violent, mindless super-men or, in some cases, super-aliens. Only the skills of a street fighter can pass this gauntlet and destroy the evil fiend responsible. And Ken will avenge his friend's death if it is the last thing he does.
