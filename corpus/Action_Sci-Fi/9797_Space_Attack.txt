Outer Space Combat contains multiple space-related games. Variant one has a cross-hair in the center of the screen that is used to fire at enemy space ships. Using the controller the player can line them up. Ships that aren't shot will ram the player and reduce points. Variant two is for two players where both players must coordinate to dock a spaceship on a space station. One player controls the ship the other the station. The third variant has one player attacking the other from the left side of the screen. The other must dodge the laser fire. The fourth variant again places one player in the role of a combatant and the other making defensive maneuvers, but this time the combatant uses the first person targeting from variant one. All games last 99 seconds and are about scoring the most points. Additionally, each game has two speed variants.
