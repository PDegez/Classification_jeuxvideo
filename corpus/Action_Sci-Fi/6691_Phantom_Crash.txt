In the year 2025 Tokyo changed. Due to air pollution, all the people moved to New Tokyo and the Old Tokyo got deserted. Now it's used for a sport called Rumbling, which is a brutal, action filled sport and the stars are customised mecha-like machines which battle against each other in arenas made exclusively for the sport. Little by little, the sport got a foothold and now is one of the most successful things in entertainment.
