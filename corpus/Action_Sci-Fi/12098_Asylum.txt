A platformer where the player enters the brain of a young man called Sigmund. Sigmund has his share of problems and the player has to resolve his mental instability by exploring the surreal world of his inner mind and shut down malfunctioning brain cells. The game plays like any traditional platformer and involves jumping around and shooting at the abstract enemies that roam around. The player can pick up different guns such as a bazooka, a minigun, and others. The game has three levels (referred to as mental zones): ego, psyche, and id. Ego is the easiest and needs to be completed before id is unlocked. Each level is big and requires exploring. The levels are full of items that the player can collect and get points for. The bottom right-hand corner shows a bonus symbol and when collected the symbol will advance until it gets a star. The player will then be transported to a bonus room. The objective of each level is simply to find all eight brain cells and shut them down.
