Around the 21st century, a nuclear war has forced humankind to dwell underground. Robotic forces threaten the last surviving city of Shangrila in Japan. A special investigator is assigned to find out the root cause of this threat and put an end to it. Some of the gameplay has the player traversing around the city solving puzzles to progress. When leaving the city, the player navigates in maze-like dungeons wearing a mecha suit with some combat encounters, fighting robots with a mix of melee and ranged attacks.
