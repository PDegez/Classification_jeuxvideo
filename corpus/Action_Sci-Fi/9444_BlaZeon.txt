This film is to Skateboarding what The Endless Summer is to Surfing. Old School Skateboarding, Rollerskating, Freestyle, and Slalom. Skateboard Tracks from the 70's before the insurance put them out of business. Some Fire, Grinders on Coping, Sliders, Aerials, Half Pipes, Huge Bowls. This stuff is really one of a kind
