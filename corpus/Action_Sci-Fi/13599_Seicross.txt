During the game play of Seicross, the player rides a gliding motorcycle-like vehicle, bumping other riders, collecting power modules and collecting blue people who are stranded. A second area removes the riders and adds rough terrain, while the final leg features a battle with one or more Dinosaur Tanks, which launch their heads when destroyed. The sequence repeats infinitely, getting progressively difficult and changing backgrounds.
