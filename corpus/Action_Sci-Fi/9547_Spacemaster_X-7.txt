Your mission is to destroy as many Hyperion Military Bases as possible. You can fire missiles through the gaps in the Force Field or from inside the Force Field. If you are able to sneak inside. you must quickly destroy the Base before the Force Field closes in on your Assault Ship. This is no easy task! The Base can construct electifying Shields during battle and is protected by a variety of deadly defenders. If you are able to avoid all of them, you will be truly deserving of the title Space Master X-7.
