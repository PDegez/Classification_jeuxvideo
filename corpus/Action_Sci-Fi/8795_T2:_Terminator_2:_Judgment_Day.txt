This version of "Terminator 2: Judgement Day" was designed specifically for the Game Boy, and is unlike the console and computer versions of the game. It is a mix of a side-scrolling run-and-gun and a puzzle game. Set in both 2029 and 1994, you begin the game in the future as John Connor fighting your way into Skynet in order to obtain a T-800. After the Terminator is reprogrammed and sent back in time, you take on the role of the T-800 in the present day where you have to protect John Connor during a motorcycle chase, break into Cyberdyne, and ultimately destroy the T-1000 at the steel mill.
