The most successful company of all is Goyolk K.K., led by Kernel Goyolk. Goyolk commands an entire military force and controls the entire Milky Way's resources, making him seemingly unstoppable. With the economy in his hands, he is also polluting Elwood's oceans and damaging the environment. As a result of this, Dr. Moly, a famous scientist, sends his niece and nephew Ice and Neneh into battle against Goyolk's forces to save the planet.
