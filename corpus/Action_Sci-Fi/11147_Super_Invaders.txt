Super Invaders is an action game in which the players must prevent aliens from landing on the earth. Players fire guided missiles which must be led to the alien UFO. The UFO releases a landing craft that will try to construct a platform for the UFO to land on, which ends the game. The player must shoot down the landing crafts to prevent the platform from being constructed. The UFO also becomes vulnerable at times. Hitting it while it is vulnerable will cause part of the platform to be destroyed again. The UFO can also try to dodge the incoming missiles and go into hyperspace, where it is invisible. Hitting the invisible UFO actually damages it and can destroy it after which a new UFO will appear. There are multiple game variations and it can be played solo or with two players playing at the same time and competing for the highest score.
