The game's premise revolves around mutated dinosaurs taking over the Earth. A group of human survivors retreated to an orbital station, and eventually returned to Earth, launching a war against the dinosaurs. The animals work together against the player. Enemies include raptors and T. Rexes. Because all the dinosaurs are mutated, they possess unusual features, including the ability to generate electricity to launch shock attacks. Some dinosaurs can spit acid, while others can dig underground, or can call reinforcements.
