The player controls a small character at the bottom of the screen who moves laterally, and can fire directly upwards. A large hawk flies from the top of the screen and attempts to capture Freddie at the bottom left of the screen and carry him to the top right. The player completes a level by shooting the small flies that roam the screen, or shooting the hawk to prevent it from capturing Freddie. After shooting the hawk, Freddie falls to the bottom of the screen, and the player must grab the basket at the bottom right of the screen and position it under Freddie before he hits the bottom. Small orbs float around the screen that become aggressive Space Invaders if shot.
