After the development of a large dimensional gateway, mankind is promptly invaded from a species of sentient beings hailing from an alternate dimension of complete chaos known as the Abo. As the Abo continues to assault the Earth for fifteen years, three fighter ships are developed using advanced dimensional jump mechanisms, capable of fighting the Abo in their own dimensional field, the Chaos Field. Three especially trained pilots - Hal, Ifumi and Jinn - are chosen to fly these ships against the Abo's most fearsome weapons and to take the fight to the Abo home world.
