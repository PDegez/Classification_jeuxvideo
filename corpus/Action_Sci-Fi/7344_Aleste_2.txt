The year is 2039, two decades after the supercomputer DIA 51 went rogue and ravaged the Earth. As Earth began to recover, the planet is suddenly attacked by a race of plant-like alien humanoids called the Vagand, with the intent of finding a new food source on Earth. In their first attack, the former Aleste forces were wiped out, among them being Colonel Waizen. Ellinor Waizen, the daughter of Ray and Yuri, is the pilot of the newest version of Aleste and is the only one who can defeat the Vagand and save Earth.
