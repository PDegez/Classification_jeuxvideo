The Illis solar system is being invaded by a mysterious alien force known as the Armada of Annihilation. They have taken over many of the system's planets including the Earth-like planet of Corliss, draining them of their resources for their power. Eventually, the only weapon powerful enough to defeat the Armada of Annihilation is a starfighter known as Axelay. As the pilot of the Axelay, you must fly your ship through six stages, three of them horizontal and three of them vertical, shooting everything that moves and defeat the boss at the end of each stage in order to defeat the Armada of Annihilation and save the Illis solar system from destruction.
