We had it coming. We created Cybrids with breakthrough AI to perform dangerous tasks with lightning precision. But we should never have taught them to fight. One apocalypse later, it's EarthSiege. Your squad of HERCs prowls a target-rich environment, ready to deliver some heavily mechanized payback. But beware - the Cybrids are an intelligent and relentless enemy. You'll constantly have to train new pilots, develop new tactics, and acquire new weapons - like EM Pulse Cannons, optically guided missiles and Electron Flux weapons - to secure an advantage. Or your burnt-jelly remains won't fill a teacup.
