It is 2046. An armed terrorist group has attacked and occupied the Togusa Building, owned by the mayor military supplier, Machinery Gear, Inc. A special commando unit has been sent to retrieve the situation, but has been caught in a trap and has sustained heavy casualties. Only two commandos have survived: Alex and Michelle. To get into the building they must defeat the super security system that is now controlled by the terrorists. Can they rescue the hostages and recover the Togua Building?
