The year is 1964, and World War I still continues. The Russian Baron von Ugenberg conquered Mongolia in an uprising following the Russian Revolution. The alternate timeline began when he invaded Soviet Union, defeated the Bolsheviks, and founded a Russo-Mongolian state, with the eventual goal of capturing the whole of Europe. United States of Western Europe (the Alliance) were established to counter that plan. Lieutenant James Anderson, a veteran soldier who has been with the Alliance since the age of nineteen, is sent on a highly dangerous mission: breach the enemy's defense line, and prevent the Russo-Mongolians from developing a new nuclear weapon.
