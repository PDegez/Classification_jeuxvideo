Sengoku Basara: Samurai Heroes is the third instalment to the series known as Devil Kings to English audiences. The game plays very much like a more arcade-oriented version of Dynasty Warriors although a lot more exaggerated and anime-styled. The game also acts as a prequel to the anime series story line. There are more than a dozen leaders to choose from, each with their own unique weapon and battle style. Each character also features their own story in Heroes' Story mode with multiple paths based on which locations the player chooses to conquer. Victory in battle will not only advance the story but will also level the character using the experience earned during the battle plus bonus experience for special requirements or secrets discovered on the battlefield. Higher levels not only provided better stats but also see characters gain new abilities. New weapons, items, accessories, allies and resources are also rewarded. Resources can be used to create various accessories that make heroes and their weapons more powerful.
