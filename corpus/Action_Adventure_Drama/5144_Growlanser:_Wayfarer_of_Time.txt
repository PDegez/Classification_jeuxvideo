Nearly 2000 years ago, humankind utilized both magic and science, and built a highly advanced civilization. However, they were attacked by powerful angels, who brought them to the brink of extinction. Humankind revived eventually from this downfall and rebuilt new civilization. However, the battle with the angels was so devastating that many things were lost, such as the technologies of magic and science. In the present time, there is no one who knows the truth of what happened; there are only legends that speak of "magic" and "angels that punished humanity". Even the existence of the angels who destroyed mankind is often dismissed as folklore. On this world there is a continent called Noievarl. There are four countries, each with their own differences, and they begin aggressions to their neighboring nations. In the south is Lamplast Island; the Arten Schwart mercenaries were hired to defend it from invasion from outside continents. However, an angel suddenly appeared and assailed the fighting humans, and the mercenary group had to flee from the battleground. The angel was so powerful that it could bring everything to nonexistence. Crevaniel, a young mercenary raised in Arten Schwart, witnessed the six-winged angel in the sky. On the night that they returned to the mainland, the captain of the mercenary group, Dixon, affirmed that he saw the angel, and they were the only two people who could see it. He said to Crevaniel that he was the "key to stop the angels". With this as his destiny, Crevaniel set out to discover how to defeat the angels and save the fate of humanity. He will become a new Savior of Light, the Growlanser.
