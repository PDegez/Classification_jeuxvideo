White Knight Chronicles is a role-playing game with an online questing mode. The player creates their own avatar with whom they interact with the main story. Combat is real-time, with each character's abilities chosen from customisable quick menus, with options for chains by assigning multiple abilities to the same slot. The online mode takes cues from Dark Cloud; players found and manage their own town from which they can invite other players with whom to take quests together.
