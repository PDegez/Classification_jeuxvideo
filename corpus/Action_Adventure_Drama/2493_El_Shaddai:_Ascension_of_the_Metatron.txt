The story of El Shaddai takes place in a fantastical interpretation of biblical themes, taking primary inspiration from the apocryphal Book of Enoch. Enoch is sent by God to capture the angels which have lapsed in their duties to watch over the human world. These angels, called Grigori, became fascinated with their charges and renounced Heaven to live and breed among the humans. Enoch must traverse their realms, battle their aberrant Nephilim offspring, finally locating the fallen angels and bring them back into Heaven's fold. As Enoch journeys, he is assisted by the head archangel Lucifel.
