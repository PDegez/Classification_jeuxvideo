She resigns Vector, and joins Underground anti-UMN organization, Scientia. An organization dedicated towards exposing Vector's crimes. Another Six Months pass, and Shion receives an invitation from her ex co-worker Allen Ridgeley into Fifth Jerusalem, only to find that the Kos-Mos project is to be replaced by the T-Weapon project.
