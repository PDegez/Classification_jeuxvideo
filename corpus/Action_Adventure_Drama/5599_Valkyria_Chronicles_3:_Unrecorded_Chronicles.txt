Similar to the original Valkyria Chronicles for PS3, this game takes place in the fictional land of Europa during the war in 1935, but follows the battles of the Nameless Unit rather than the Gallian Army. Members of this special unit leave their names and their pasts behind when joining, to be from then on referred to only by number.
