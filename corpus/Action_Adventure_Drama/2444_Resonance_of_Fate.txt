Resonance of Fate is a role-playing game that takes place in the future when the Earth becomes too poisonous to live on and humanity moves to the machine-city of Basel. It is a city built high up to the sky upon a tower-like structure. The story of the game focuses on Vashyron, who is the leader of the PMF (Private Military Firm), as well as two other characters named Zephyr and Leanne, who join Vashyon's group and take on missions from the citizens of Basel.
