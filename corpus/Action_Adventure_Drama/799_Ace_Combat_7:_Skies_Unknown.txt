The year is 2019. The Osean government sponsored construction of a space elevator on the Usea continent to help with the reconstruction effort, after the continent was affected by the Ulysses meteor strike. The Kingdom of Erusea, in fears of losing its grasp on nearby countries, used drones to carry out terrorist attacks in Osea, and later declaring war on Osea, claiming that Osea is compromising its sovereignty. Erusea used drones to carry out clean attacks while Osea was criticized for its "accidental" indiscriminate bombings of civilians. The public opinion shifts towards Erusea's favor, and the skies are no longer dominated by human pilots.
