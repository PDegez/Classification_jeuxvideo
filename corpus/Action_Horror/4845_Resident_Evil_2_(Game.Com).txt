Designed for the Tiger Game.Com, this black and white remake of Resident Evil 2, is a side-scrolling shooter that follows Leon's story. However, due to the system's limited space, many of the original game's mechanics, cutscenes, music, and aesthetics were either drastically altered or completely removed.
