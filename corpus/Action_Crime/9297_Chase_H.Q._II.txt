It's your job to bust suspects that are to fast for the Highway Patrol. As a member of the elite chase division you have an arsenal of built vehicles to choose from: a screaming sports car, a ferocious 4x4, and a souped Semi. You'll need them all as you nail criminals from the urban jungles to the snow choked mountains. And we mean nail. These bad guys don't give up until you batter their cars into scrap metal. Based on the smash arcade hit, Chase H.Q. II tears up the road.
