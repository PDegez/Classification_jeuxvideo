If there's one thing you learn on the street, it's that somebody's got to have your back, and you've got to have theirs. Your Gs are your life. Anyone who tries to go it alone is a dead man. You get taken in by an O.G. like Dupree, the man who claimed and has defended the largest street-racing area in South Central since you were in diapers, and you count yourself blessed. Buck did. Blessed or plain lucky 'til now. You see, Dupree just met his match; an East Coast O.G. named Cortez looking for some new turf. Dupree also met nine of Cortez' bullets, and he's as torn up as he is mad. Now he's asking Buck to help him reclaim his turf and give Cortez a send-off he won't live to forget. Book smart and wise to the rules of the street, Buck enlists the help of sexy Queen B and sets out to teach Cortez some respect. With Dupree's guidance, he's got to deliver key packages and race Cortez' gang of rough-riding thugs if he wants to take back the old hood. This ain't no friendly drag race. Here, the difference between winning and losing is life or death.
