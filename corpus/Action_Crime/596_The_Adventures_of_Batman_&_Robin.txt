The Sega CD version of "The Adventures of Batman and Robin" is a driving/flying simulator game. When Commissioner Gordon and Robin disappear, Batman takes to the streets and skies of Gotham in the Batmobile and Batwing. In order to locate them, Batman must confront Poison Ivy, the Riddler, and the Joker. The stages and levels are intercut with original scenes from the animated series, essentially creating a playable episode.
