The Sega Genesis version of "The Adventures of Batman and Robin" is a side-scrolling brawler game. Playing as either Batman or Robin, you have battle your way through four levels full of Mr. Freeze's goons (including the Joker, Two-Face, and the Mad Hatter) in order to stop him from blasting Gotham with his ice cannon.
