The evil Fat Cat is at it again. He tricked the Rescue Rangers into thinking their neighbor's kitten was kidnapped, when in fact Fat Cat had lead them into a trap. He's taken Gadget to his hideout in a casino. So Chip and Dale go on a big adventure, with Zipper and Monty helping out along the way. They must dodge robot dogs and mice in a laboratory, watch out for evil houseflies and aliens in a kitchen, killer toys in a toy store, avoid falling balls and disappearing platforms in a warehouse, watching out for that first step in the casino, then rescuing Gadget and catching Fat Cat by traveling through a treacherous sewer, an office, and finally Fat Cat's factory. A job nothing short of adventurous.
