Your self-designed character is the manager of a line of highly popular theme parks owned by Uncle Mortimer, who is the designer of many great theme-park-related inventions. There are five different parks, and each one has three sections that all tie in to the same overall theme. Sometimes, some of the rides for the park continue the same theme. During your park's rise to fame, you have to deal with many attempts to take down its popularity, mainly from Vernon Garrison, a rival character who runs another chain of theme parks called Globo-Joy. The game's main objective is to keep your customers happy so that they don't get bored. Throughout the game, there are many mini-games and missions to be played, and there is a separate multiplayer mini-game section outside of the main game, as well as another section where coasters can be created and saved to be used inside the game later on.
