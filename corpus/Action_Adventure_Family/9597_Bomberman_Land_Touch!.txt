In the Story mode, the player takes the role of Cheerful White, who is invited by his friend Giant Gold, along with his other pals - Cute Pink, Cool Black, Bookworm Green and Kid Blue - to the Bomber Pirate Island. The Story mode itself revolves around a multi-themed theme-park, with caves, aquariums, and mountains that divide the five zones present in the game, and the constant theme for Cheerful White being to become the "Pirate King" of Bomber Pirate Island.
