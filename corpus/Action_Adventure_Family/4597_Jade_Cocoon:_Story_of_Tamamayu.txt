Levant is a young boy from a village Syrus. Long time ago the country was cursed by a powerful spirit. Since then the forests around Syrus are populated by monsters. Levant's father was a Cocoon Master - a hunter who could capture those monsters, purge their corrupted souls through holy powers and make them serve the people. But Levant's father disappeared long ago in the woods, and now it's Levant's turn to be the new Cocoon Master. On the day of his initiation, which is also the day he marries his lovely girlfriend Mahbu, he receives his first dangerous mission.
