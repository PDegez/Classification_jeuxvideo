A 10+ Player CO-OP, VR and Desktop Crossplay Sci-fi Action Game Alien Dawn bridges the gap between VR and Desktop players in this sci-fi action multiplayer game. While this game was designed with VR in mind first, VR adoption by a large percentage of people still has a long way to go. That is why it is so important to include a Desktop mode that is just as fun as the VR version along with parity of the VR player features. If you're a VR player looking for a game to enjoy with your friends that have yet to adopt VR, this is it.
