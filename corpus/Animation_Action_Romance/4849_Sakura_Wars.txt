It is the Taishou Era in Japan, and the Western world has begun to make its way through traditional Japan. Technology is evolving, and the use of steam has made for great breakthroughs in transportation in weaponry. But the world faces a deadly threat: a dark cult wishes to destroy Japan and the very world itself. To combat any possible threats, the Imperial government of Japan brings together six young ladies from around the world to form the Hanagumi (Flower Bridage) division of the Teikoku Kagekidan (Imperial Floral Assault Group). Clad in their proud spiritual armor, the Kobou, these young women are the frontline of defense against the demon worshippers, but they haven't a leader to guide them into battle.
