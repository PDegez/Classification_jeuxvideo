Ichiro Ogami goes to Paris, to command the pretty girls of Paris Kagekidan (Flower Assault Squad), led by the lovely Erica. Just as in Japan, this special unit has a complex base which is disguised as a theater, since the girls of Paris Kagekidan can act on stage as well as pilot huge steam-powered mechs. An unknown evil is threatening the city, so it's time for Ichiro to take command and save Paris from the demonic threat.
