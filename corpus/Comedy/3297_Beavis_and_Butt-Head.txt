Beavis and Butt-Head are now on the Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo. Yep, those two are at it again! This time they've obtained tickets to Gwar, the coolest rock group on earth. One day while they were jamming to the music of Gwar, tickets in hand, their neighbor Tom Anderson's dog lept up and stole the tickets and dropped them in the yard, seconds later Anderson's riding mower shredded them to bits and the pieces blew all over town. So using teamwork, Beavis and Butt-Head search high and low all over Highland for their prized Gwar tickets. Their journey takes them to famous places like Highland High School, Turbo Mall 2000, Hospital, Burger World, Drive-In, Streets, and more! Plus Beavis and Butt-Head must match wits (if any) with such characters from the TV show as Tom Anderson, Principal McVicker, Mr. Buzzcut, Todd, Earl, and more! So join everyone's favorite gruesome twosome in a game that doesn't suck! With your help, Beavis and Butt-Head can see Gwar in person!
