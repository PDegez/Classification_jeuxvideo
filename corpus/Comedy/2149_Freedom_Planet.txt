Freedom Planet is a high-speed platform game that aims to capture the spirit and raw energy of 16-bit gaming, not through unusual gimmicks but through a mix of engaging level design and straight-up action. While it uses many of the same gameplay elements as Sonic the Hedgehog games, including stage gimmicks and character design, it takes place in a completely new verse with original characters.
