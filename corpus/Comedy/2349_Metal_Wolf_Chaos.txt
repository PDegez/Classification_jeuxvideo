In the early 21st century, America has plunged into a state of civil and economic unrest, and several states attempt to secede from America to protect their own interests as a result, leading to a conflict known as the Arizona Insurrection. During that time, Richard Hawk and Michael Wilson fight and crush the Insurrection, paving the way for development of powerful military weapons. Michael Wilson, a relative of Woodrow Wilson, soon becomes the 47th President of the United States, drawing parallels to the real life presidency of George W. Bush at the time of the game's release. Vice President Richard Hawk decides to usurp Wilson's presidency, shifting the armed forces' loyalty to him and attacking Wilson with their support. Hawk begins a reign of terror and makes numerous detrimental actions as president, from re-instituting slavery to committing outright atrocities.
