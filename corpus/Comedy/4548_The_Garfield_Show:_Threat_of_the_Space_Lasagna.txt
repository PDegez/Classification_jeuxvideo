Space Lasagnas are preparing to invade the Earth. They will first have to neutralize their most terrible opponent: the endlessly hungry Garfield. Thanks to their mighty hypnotizing laser, the Lasagnas turn the mice completely mad. The mice become crazy and start invading the whole city, causing chaos everywhere. The only way for Garfield to wash the hypnosis away is to beat the mice down. To do so, Garfield will chase the mice into Jon's house, Vito's pizzeria and even the butcher's shop in order to teach the mice a good lesson. Garfield has to do all he can to thwart the Lasagnas' plans and eradicate the threat of the Space Lasagnas.
