"You wanna be a Ghostbuster? I'm Dr. Ray Stantz, Director of Recruitment Research and Trainee Certification. Here is your shot to show me what you've got. The owner and ONLY tenant of an old apartment building in New York's Garment District claims it's being haunted by an ancient ghost. You and up to three friends or family team members will strap on a positron collider, get into that apartment building and bust any ghosts you find. I'll contact you and your group once you're on site. It's your turn - to be a Ghostbuster.
