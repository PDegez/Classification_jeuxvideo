Tropico 2: Pirate Cove is the sequel to the award-winning Fun in the Sun Caribbean simulation, Tropico. As a Pirate King, rule a secret pirate island full of despicable 17th century Sea Dogs. Fuel your economy by plundering wealthy merchant ships and taking prisoners back to the island as captive workers. Keep your scurvy buccaneers satisfied with rowdy gambling, jolly feasting, and barrels of rum. World powers fear you; brigands respect you, captives obey your every command, and don't forget about the wenching. Argh, Thar ain't nuttin like bein' a Pirate King.
