Goin' Quackers begins with Donald Duck, Gladstone Gander, and Gyro Gearloose watching TV reporter Daisy Duck discovering the temple of Merlock The Magician; whom she is kidnapped. His arch rival Gladstone sets out to find her before Donald, who decides to use Gyro's new invention, the "Tubal Teleport System", to track down Merlock and Daisy. However, the machine doesn't have enough power to get there, and to make the machine working again, Donald must go on a journey to restore power to the machine. Along the way, he must compete with Gladstone, reverse the spells that Merlock put on Huey, Dewey, and Louie's toys, and defeat several bosses, including the Beagle Boys and Magica De Spell. In the end, Donald is able to locate Merlock; he defeats him and rescues Daisy. The temple collapses, but Gyro is able to teleport them back to his lab, where Donald receives a kiss from Daisy for saving her.
