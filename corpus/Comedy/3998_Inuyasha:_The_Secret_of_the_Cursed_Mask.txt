While preparing for the annual Festival of Dolls at the  shrine, Kururugi (either male Michiru or female Kaname, or you can change the first name of the character) falls through a broken floor board with an odd star symbol on it in the storage house. When Kururugi regains his/her senses, s/he finds him/herself in the Warring States Era. Soon s/he meets half-demon dog Inuyasha and joins his group along with fellow time-tossed teen Kagome Higurashi, young fox demon Shippo, the lecherous monk Miroku, and demon slayer Sango. Occassionally the group meets a blind traveler named Kakaju, who helps the group on their quest and helps your character understand the power of Shikigami. Together with Inuyasha and his friends, Kururugi travels Feudal Japan in search of clues of why s/he was brought to this time and find a way to send him/her back to the present. Although, after spending time with a certain member of this group, will s/he really want to go home?
