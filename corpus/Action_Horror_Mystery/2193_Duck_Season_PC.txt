Duck Season is a throwback to the golden age of 1980's gaming and movies with a hint of horror in a Spielberg-ian universe. A first person experimental narrative uncovering a story with multiple branches. Re-live a slice of childhood as you transported to an eerily familiar memory and play out the dark story that unfolds over a single day/night as your imagination takes over.
