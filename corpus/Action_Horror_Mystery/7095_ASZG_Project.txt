After a long period of global pandemic, the new virus DK-19 assailed the population. Many deniers claim that genetic mutation was a side effect caused by vaccines developed in a short period of testing and research. However, political activists fight this claim by saying that the genetic mutations of the DK-19 virus are from infected people who, in a negacionista position, contracted the virus in an asymptomatic way, stimulating mutations through adverse treatments, such as the use of Chloroquine and Viagra. Regardless of the cause of the mutations, the DK-19 virus caused great damage to the bodies of the infected, generating chaos that had long been predicted.
