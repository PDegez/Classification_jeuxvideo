You control a space-suited figure carrying a pump and a drill that moves around a horizontal scrolling island avoiding Pookas and fire-breathing dragons. Drill on 'fault lines' and sink parts of the island to kill the bad guys or pump them just like the original. There are many different levels and islands and the play area is viewed at an angle from front and above.
