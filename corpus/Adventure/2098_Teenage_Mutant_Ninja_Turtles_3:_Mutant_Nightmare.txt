In their third outrageous, bodacious adventure, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles must save New York from an invasion of that unruly alien race, The Triceratons, who have come in search of the Fugitoid, a.k.a. Professor Honeycutt, inventor of the Transmat teleportal device. The Triceratons kidnap April O'Neil and Casey Jones, and take them to their mother ship in space. The turtles must team up, rescue their pals and send the Triceratons back where they came from. Next, they must stop the evil Agent Bishop from extracting their DNA and using it to create a race of evil mutants to do his own dastardly bidding; and finally, their arch-nemesis The Shredder plans to leave for outer space to cause even more trouble for the Utroms. It's a race against time as the turtles follow Shredder into space in order to face him for one final showdown.
