Set twenty years after the events of The New Colossus, the protagonist is depicted as a computer hacker nicknamed Cyberpilot who works for the French Resistance against the Nazi regime. It takes place chronologically a week prior to the events of Youngblood, serving as a separate side story to the main narrative. Unlike its predecessors, however, the game is specifically designed to be a virtual reality experience rather than an adaptable instrument to various formats. Cyberpilot was released alongside Youngblood on the same day in 2019.
