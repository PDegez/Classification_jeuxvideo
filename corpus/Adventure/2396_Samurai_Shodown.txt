Samurai Shodown, known as Samurai Spirits in Japan, is a fighting game by SNK released in June 2019. The game is a reboot of the Samurai Shodown series and the first "mainline" game since 2008's Samurai Shodown Sen, marking an 11 year gap between the releases themselves. This game is also the first for SNK in having to utilize Unreal Engine graphics (in this case, Unreal Engine 4).
