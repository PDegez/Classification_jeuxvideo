Infinity Blade tells the story of a bloodline of knights, raised from birth to journey to the Dark Citadel and fight a one-on-one duel with the God King, the despotic ruler of the land. Each knight that falls is avenged by his son, then his son, and so on, until the God King is finally defeated by Siris, the last of the Bloodline, who finds the God-King's citadel hides a great many secrets about the Deathless lords and the world they rule.
