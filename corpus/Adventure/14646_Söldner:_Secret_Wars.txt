Söldner: Secret Wars is similar to the recent online FPS combat games involving infantry and vehicular warfare. But it also has a few features that separate it from the rest. The Advanced Destruction System means you're no longer restricted to how a map should look. You can knock down trees to block a road or destroy a bridge to prevent armour from crossing. Damage remains until the end of the round instead of being just a decal that does not affect game play. Unit are able to be customized. You can choose your look, headgear, uniform and add extras like sunglasses and backpacks. Söldner features a large variety of weapons including the basic pistols and rifles but also features specialized items like sniper rifles, explosives and rocket launchers. There is a large variety of vehicles available to the player as well. The other major game play feature is the command structure. An elected leader is able to set out objectives and waypoints for team members. As well as allocating funds for weapon and vehicle purchases. Bringing a more cohesive sense of game play to the battlefield.
