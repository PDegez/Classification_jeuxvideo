Follow the adventures of air pirate Nathan Zachary and his band of fighters in 1937. The United States Great Depression has caused the lands of North America to split into numerous mini-nations. Nathan Zachary, an American World War I veteran, commands a group of rogues called the Fortune Hunters (whom commit acts of piracy with a style of class, never killing the innocent or their opponents). Many evil forces find Zachary's chivalry to be irritating, and him to be a threat. Zachary fights renegade British commandos, corrupt German diplomats, criminal security firms, and fellow pirates in his high-stakes aim to rule the crimson skies of North America.
