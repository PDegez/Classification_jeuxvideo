power stone 2 adds heaps of new characters and environments to the already established crew however there are now 4 players doing battle at a time in both single and multiplayer modes this time the top 2 from every round in other words the two that survive each fight of 4 players progress to the next round and after a few rounds you will battle it out with huge bosses that take up most of the screen there are plenty of new power ups that litter each arena including guns hammers extra power stones and plenty more you can also hop into a gun turret for extra blasting fun and of course the power stones are available to use
