It is a fun arcade/platform game, made by CDV Software, and Joymania Development. The idea is to help Santa find all his missing presents, and load them onto the sleigh, so he can deliver them to all the children. Of course, things are not that simple. Santa has many obstacles to get through, including evil trolls, high platforms, and slippery ice patches. There are 10 levels altogether, graphics are beautiful. The whole world is a 3D winter wonderland, with us, the player, watching Santa from behind. Music consists of 4 Christmas carols, which are on a loop, and repeat endlessly.
