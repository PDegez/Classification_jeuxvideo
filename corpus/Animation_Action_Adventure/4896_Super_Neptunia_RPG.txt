In one of infinite dimensions, the world of Gamindustri exists a world where 2D games reign supreme. An organization known as Bombyx Mori fiercely devoted to these games rules over this vibrant world and their devotion comes with a heavy price as citizens of Gamindustri are forced to offer 2D games to Bombyx Mori as taxes. Those who dare to use new technologies or create games that don't meet their standards risk being banished to the Trial Grounds. It is in this Gamindustri, a dark world with no real future in sight, that Neptune wakes from her sleep and with a strange book in hand, she sets off on the journey of a Hero.
