This is the story of Ardora, a continent of Lapis. A tiny spark here ignites the flames that would embroil the entire continent in conflict. A conflict, later spoken of, as the War of the Visions. Leonis, ruled by the red lion monarch, possesses the power of Visions, as well as twin princes. Hourne, the great Western kingdom, governed by a policy of peace and its brave and wise King. Fennes, where the King of the savages has organized the barbarian tribes into Ardora's mightiest militant state. Wezette, the great Eastern kingdom, over which reigns its icy despot. Crystal Sanctum, a religious city state with believers throughout Ardora, founded by one who claims to be God. Each burdened with its own dignity, thus is the curtain drawn on a struggle in which the fate of nations rests. All is for one's Homeland. War of the Visions: Final Fantasy Brave Exvius.
