The game's story covers part of the Millennium Falcon Arc from the manga volumes 22 to 27. With its more detailed polygonal models, it is visually more sophisticated than its five years' predecessor on Sega Dreamcast. The maps are much larger than in the first game. Motion Capture process was used for added realism in character moves. Voice dubbing was made with the original anime TV series cast.
