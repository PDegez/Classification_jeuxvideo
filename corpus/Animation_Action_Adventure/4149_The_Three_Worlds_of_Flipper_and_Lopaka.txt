The game is dedicated to the children of 6 to 10 years and is based on the Australian animated series about the adventures of 11-year-old Polynesian boy Lopaka and his best friend, a dolphin named Flipper. We also meet other characters from the series, like girl Nola, the evil giant purple octopus Dexter etc. "The Three Worlds of Flipper and Lopaka" is composed mostly of 12 mini-games set in the three worlds (those of Lopaka, Nola and Flipper - respectively, 'The Mountains', 'The Shoreline' and 'The Sea'). The challenges present some simple arcade adventures or educational puzzles. The first three games in each world could be completed in any order, then the fourth mini-game becomes available, and after that we can proceed to the next world. After all the three worlds are done, we can play the 'ultimate challenge' of searching for objects and then making out a jigsaw-puzzle.
