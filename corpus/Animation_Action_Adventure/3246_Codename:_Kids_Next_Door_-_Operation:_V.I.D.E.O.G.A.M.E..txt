The powerful villain known as 'Father' has recently freed various villains from the Kids Next Door Arctic Base, a prison for criminal adults such as Stickybeard, Knightbrace, The Common Cold, Gramma Stuffum, The Toiletnator, and more nasty villains. It's up to the Sector V Team, the heroes of the cartoon series, to capture them and gather "Powuh Ups," collect and build their weapons, and get ready for an epic showdown on the Moon Base.
