Nothing is as it seems and nothing will ever be the same again. Your friend, Alec Trevelyan, is your enemy - and he will use GoldenEye technology to encode and fire a satellite with enough electro-magnetic pulse (EMP) to destroy the world's communication and computer systems. Time is the greatest enemy of all. You must defeat Trevelyan, the Russian soldiers, General Ourumov, and Xenia before GoldenEye 's satellite is fired at the Earth. The world needs 007 like never before - but will you be too late?
