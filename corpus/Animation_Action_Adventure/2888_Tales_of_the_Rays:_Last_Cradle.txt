Demitrius, who ruled Asgard as its emperor, seeks to return to Nibelung. In order to do so, he sacrifices Mercuria's mirrite, Morian, to revive Bifrost. Morian, who was annihilated in order to generate a large quantity of chiral particles, becomes a death mirrite and takes over Mercuria's body to seek revenge. However, Morian is slain and Mercuria is freed by Ix's party during their adventures in Bifrost. In the process, Kocis learns about the Eye of Balor housed in his left eye. Its power once destroyed Nibelung, and should never have been created. In order to learn more about the nature of this power, Kocis decides to leave Ix's party and confront the Bifrost forces. What can be done to save the world from the empire's plans? When Ix and Kocis's intentions intersect, the battle between Ix's party and the empire will enter its final stage.
