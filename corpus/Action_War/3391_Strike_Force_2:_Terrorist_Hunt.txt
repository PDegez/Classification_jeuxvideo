A tropical paradise turned into a war-zone. One of our agents was on the mission to investigate a para-militarized terrorist organization lead by a former German secret service agent. We lost his tracking signal. The last message we got was his coordinates and request for extraction. You are a member of the Strike Force Unit, code named Viper. Your objective is to rescue our agent and combat the terrorist organization. Gear up with a modern arsenal of machine guns, assault rifles, sniper rifles and pistols with intel from HQ Commander and fulfill your objective.
