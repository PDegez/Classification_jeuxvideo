On the eve of the U.S. presidential election, the two presidential candidates, Senator Watts and Vice President Cardiff are attacked. Major Jason Richter of Task Force Talon intervenes, sending Sergeant Major Ray Jefferson and Sergeant Oz Jackson respectively to rescue Senator Watts and Vice President Cardiff. During the operation to rescue Cardiff, President Baldwin is assassinated with an explosive device while his motorcade is leaving the White House. Although both succeed in their missions, Senator Watts disappears shortly thereafter and is announced dead by officials. Vice President Cardiff survives and becomes the new President of the United States.
