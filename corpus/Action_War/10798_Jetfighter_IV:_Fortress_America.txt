Defend the USA. Take the high-tech arsenal of F-22 Raptor, F/A-18 Hornet, and F-14 Tomcat against terrorists and invading armies. Start by taking on insurgents holed up near the Lake Tahoe area and eventually take on the combined might of Russian and Chinese forces all over Northern California. Fly over famous landmarks including the Golden Gate Bridge and the Bay Bridge, Transamerica Pyramid, and more. This game puts the ACTION back into flight sims.
