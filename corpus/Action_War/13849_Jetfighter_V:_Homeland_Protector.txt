While on a routine training mission, you've been suddenly called back to base. It seems that an invasion fleet has been sighted just off the waters of US West Coast. Just a few days ago, North Korea has reported that an unknown force has attacked its main base, and made off with a large amount of fighters, bombers, tanks, trucks, warships, and more. US Forces are already tied down in the Middle East... Which means you, the rest of rookie pilots on this base, and some National Guard units, are all that stands in the way of this invasion of American soil. Take to the air in F-16 Fighting Falcon, F-35 JSF, or F-22 Raptor, and stop the invaders.
