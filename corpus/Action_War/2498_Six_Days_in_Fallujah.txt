Six Days was inspired by a Marine who was badly wounded during the battle of Fallujah and wanted to make sure that everyone learned from his experiences and the experiences of the Iraqi forces that fought alongside him. This game was created with the cooperation of Marines, Iraqi soldiers and Iraqi civilians. It will include documentary-style interviews with people who were involved with the conflict.
