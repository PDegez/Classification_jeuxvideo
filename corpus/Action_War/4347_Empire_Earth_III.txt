Once a province is under your control, you need to assign a role to it. Depending on what role you assign, the province will either produce one of the three available resources or be a place where you can recruit new armies. You can then move those armies around on the map in turn-based mode. But of course you are not alone on the world and the tribes aren't giving up their territory so easily either. So you will need to fight many battles.
