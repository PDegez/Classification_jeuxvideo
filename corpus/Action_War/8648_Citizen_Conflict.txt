Ether Islands is a dystopian world set in the year 2101, consisting of 10 districts. The original Earth world is now called Terra, dominated by a planetary government set to rule over its citizens. Terra government has adopted strict measures to tackle the ecological disaster that was threatening the world and has forbidden the connection of AI with humans. The adoption of a more natural lifestyle based on social inclusion, equality, anti-growth, and scarcity has led to the creation of The Order, a powerful resistance group. The Order consisted of powerful and wealthy elites who demanded a place where they could live by the rules they didn't follow, but determined. And thus, Ether Island was created and got populated by everyone who preferred chaos and power struggle to peace and equality.
