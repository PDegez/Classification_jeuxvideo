Hyperdimension Neptunia: Re;Birth1 is a 3D turn-based jRPG and an enhanced remake of the PS3 game Hyperdimension Neptunia. Many parts of the game are entirely identical. It has the same universe and the main story is the same. Neptunia, the main heroine is a goddess defeated in wars by three other goddesses. However, there are several new mechanics for this version like the "remake system" to find new dungeons and in-battle perks, characters changes and tweaks to the story. The visuals are entirely reworked and there is new music and voice-acting.
