In a "What-If" scenario, World War II ends with Japan not surrendering and the U.S. not deploying nukes. It drags on for years, and eventually is split down the middle like Korea would be years later. The North is controlled by the Soviet Union, and the South is controlled by allies (with Germans for some reason). You take on the role of a half-German half-Japanese Masami Weizegar (spelling might be off) and lead a rag-tag guerrilla southern Japanese mech force through many pitched battles in the North as you attempt to retrieve a stolen mech.
