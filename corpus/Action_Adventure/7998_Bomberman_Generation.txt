The Bomb Elements, powerful crystals containing unknown power connected to the origin of the universe, are unearthed and transported to Planet Bomber by Professor Ein, but the ship carrying them is attacked and destroyed by the Crush Bombers, hired guns of the Hige Hige Bandits, who want to claim the Elements for themselves to dominate space. The crystals descend to the nearby planet Tentacalls, and Bombeman is dispatched to find them and bring them back.
