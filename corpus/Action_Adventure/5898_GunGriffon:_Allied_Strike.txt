As natural resources grow scarce, the world plunges into war while governments attempt to hold on to what little remains. The weapon of choice in these conflicts is the AWGS (Armored Walking Gun System), a multipurpose tank that can walk, roll, and fly in any environment. Several AWGS models can be chosen for each mission, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. AWGS are equipped with a long range rifle, vulcan canon, short range missile barrage, and long range guided missiles, and each can be selected from different available models. Missions take place in and around Burma, and have varied objectives such as defending a base or destroying a supply convoy.
