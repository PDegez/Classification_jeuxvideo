The world is on the brink of a war between the United States and the Russian Federation. Tensions are rising, and even a minor misunderstanding could ignite the fire and throw the planet into a full-blown nuclear battle. You will enter the near-future world of the protagonist Hanako Higasa, a Japanese cyber security specialist whose parents died during a top-secret, undercover investigation of the potential source of the conflict between the two and take the initiative to finish what they started while also looking into their death. You will investigate the incident by breaking into corporate data centers and following the clues found amongst the vast amounts of data captured there to find out what may have caused this and how to put a stop to this imminent nuclear threat. You will travel around Japan, and later in the game, the story will take you to the United States.
