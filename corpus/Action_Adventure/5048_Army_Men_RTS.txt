Things have gone wrong already. A Green Army soldier, Colonel Blintz turned Tan. He got a "disfiguring head wound" in his last battle. Instead, he lost his mind literally! If any of the soldiers under his command disobeyed him, they get melted. In order to retaliate, Colonel Grimm has the Bravo Company Commandos leading the rest of the army to put an end to Colonel Blintz's madness.
