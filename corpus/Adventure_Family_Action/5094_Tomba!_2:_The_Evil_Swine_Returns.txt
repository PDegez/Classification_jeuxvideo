One day, Tomba, who has been living in peace after all that Evil Pig business, receives a strange envelope. The envelope contains a bug-Zippo, who can be very annoying-and a letter saying that Tomba's childhood friend Tabby has vanished. Furious, Tomba goes to her village. There, he discovers a green ball of energy that takes a black bag with a pig snout on it...it seems the Evil Pigs are back, and they're even stronger than before. The Pigs of Fire, Ice, Ghost, Earth, and Water have cursed the land and ruined lives again. To make matters worse, one of them is behind Tabby's kidnapping. It seems she had a golden pendant on that they wanted-we all know Evil Pigs love gold. Tomba now needs to re-seal these five Evil Pigs and free the areas they have cursed, eventually finding the one that captured Tabby. Aided by a strange old wizard named Kainen, Tomba's off to pulverize the pigs again.
