The 12th installment of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms series. The management phase and the fighting phase are the two main parts of the game. In the management phase, you construct structures in your cities to generate money, food, renown, and troops, or to improve your defense, enhance the strength, defense, range, and speed of your army, develop special plans, and construct siege weapons. The management phase is based on a turn-based system. The war phase is where you deploy all of your newly obtained officers, troops, siege weapons, and researches in the hopes of winning additional territory or avoiding territorial loss. Fights are real-time, although they may be halted at any point to give commands or employ special powers.
