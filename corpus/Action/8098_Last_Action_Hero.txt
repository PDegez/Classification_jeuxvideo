The 16-bit console version (Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis) of "Last Action Hero" is primarily a side-scrolling beat'em up, with driving sequences between levels. Jack Slater must punch and kick his way through various goons and bosses in both the film world and real world before his timer runs out.
