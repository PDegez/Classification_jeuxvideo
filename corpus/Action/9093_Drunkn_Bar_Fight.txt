Throw punches, bottles, darts, chairs, tip jars or anything else you can get your hands on at opponents. Enjoy performing socially unacceptable behavior without the resulting obligatory visits to the hospital, jail and courts. The only limits to the mayhem is your imagination and your moral decency.
