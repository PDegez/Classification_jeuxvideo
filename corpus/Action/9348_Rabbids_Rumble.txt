Rabbids Rumble is a turn-based strategy mini-game video game for the Nintendo 3DS. Rabbids Rumble centers around battling within 7 differently-themed worlds, in which the player's party and the current foe's party take turns attacking each other until only one side has health remaining. When a rabbid loses in battle, a new party member takes their place until there are no more fighters left on one side. It features 102 playable Rabbids, who are earned by playing the different modes; StreetPass; or the packaged AR card, each with their own simple moveset. As the box art shows, these Rabbids include a professional wrestler, a football player, a superhero, a dragon, a Spartan, and an astronaut, among others. The game contains various mini-games, alongside the main fighting mode. StreetPass can be used to battle friends.
