The third story is set in the world of Asteria, shortly after the events of the "Savior of Light and Darkness" arc. The world has been thrown into a state of confusion by mysterious cases of crystallizations and a new prophecy titled the "Memory of the Stars." But amidst this chaos rises seven heroes, each with their own sense of conviction and justice.
