Be an artillery commander, submarine captain, or aircraft bombardier, firing at enemy ships and planes. Or, relax with some R&R at a shooting gallery - picking off animated ducks, rabbits and clowns. Targets come from different directions, at different speeds to test and sharpen you hand/eye coordination skills.
