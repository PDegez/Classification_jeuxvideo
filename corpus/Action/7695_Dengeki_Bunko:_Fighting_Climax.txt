Dengeki Bunko: Fighting Climax sports a character roster of 14 playable characters and 23 assist characters including playable bosses Akira Yuki from Virtua Fighter and Selvaria Bles from Valkyria Chronicles. With playable characters such as Asuna from Sword Art Online or Kuroyukihime from Accel World and support characters like Touma Kamijou from A Certain Magical Index or Izaya Orihara from Durarara, Dengeki Bunko: Fighting Climax makes the most unlikely of character matchups a reality.
