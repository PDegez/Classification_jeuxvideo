Kevin Nash and Scott Hall along with Hulk Hogan were the first to form the NWO, and through that invention came some of the most dynamic and memorable wrestling matches and promotions of our time. Sting and K-dog, along with Lex Luger, and Nash and Hall went on to oppose the Black and White NWO with their own faction called the Wolf Pack.
