A video game adaptation of the card game Uno. Players start with seven cards each with one card in the "discard pile". The object of the game is to discard all your cards, saying "Uno" when you only have one left, which you do by discarding the same colour or number as the card on the top of the pile. The cards are numbered 1-9 and come in four colours, including a Reverse (the game play changes from left-to-right to right-to-left or vice-versa), Skip (skips the next person), Draw Two (the next person is skipped and draws two cards), Wild (changes the discard pile to the colour you choose), and Wild Draw Four cards.
