Stuntman: Ignition follows a small-time stunt driver as he tries to make his way to become a top Hollywood stunt driver. At the start of each new movie, the player is presented with a short movie clip which introduces the director and a brief summary of what the movie is about. The game challenges players to pull off death-defying stunts with precision driving by dropping them into the stunt-man's adrenaline-fueled role, helping to make "Night Avenger", "Strike Force Omega", "Never Kill Me Again", "Aftershock", "Overkill" and "Whoopin' and a Hollerin' II".
