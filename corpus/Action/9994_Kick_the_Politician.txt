The purpose of the app is to give the general public the chance to vent by beating up on political figures. Stress is released by tossing President Barack Obama around like a rag doll while he shouts some of his most famous quotes along with phrases like "Ouch that hurts!". After hitting former president George Bush with a stream of electricity from your taser you can spot him sneaking a drink from his flask and repeating phrases like "I need some alcohol" and "This is more painful than waxing Laura's bush". All and all the purpose of the app is to poke fun at what are normally serious issues as well as give Democrats and Republicans a chance to beat on the other side, and be able to do it in a fun way.
