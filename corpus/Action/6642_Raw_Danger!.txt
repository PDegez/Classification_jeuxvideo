The year is 2010. The underground city, Geo City, located beneath the thriving city of Del Ray, is a project put together to design the safest and most advanced city ever built in the world. The newly opened city is working great and the Mayor's Conference to commemorate the opening is going well, aside from a bit of rain outside. Joshua and Stephanie are just two of the waiters helping make the conference go as smoothly as possible. But, when the nearby levee breaks and the Hudson River begins to flood the city from above, the building the conference is being held in begins to be pummeled and destroyed by the raging rapids. The city and everyone in it are in total panic and turmoil.
