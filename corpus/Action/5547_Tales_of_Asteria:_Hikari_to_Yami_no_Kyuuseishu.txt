The second story begins shortly after the events of the "Star Fragments" arc. A thunderous roar reverberates throughout the land, the ground shatters, and unusual events begin occurring throughout the world. As the world teeters on the brink of destruction, a group of heroes begin their journeys, each with different hopes in mind. Together with an amnesiac girl named Kanonno, they will face their tale of destiny.
