The Amiga version of "Last Action Hero" is a side-scrolling brawler (in the vein of Double Dragon or Final Fight). Jack Slater must punch and kick his way through five levels (streets, warehouse, his house) of goons and bosses, including Benedict, the Ripper, and some created just for this game. Unlike the other games based on the film, this one lacks the driving levels and cut-scenes.
