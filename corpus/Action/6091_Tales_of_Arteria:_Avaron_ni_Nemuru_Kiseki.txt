The fifth chapter is set on Asteria, and continues shortly after the events of "Echoes of Paradise." An island called Avalon suddenly appears, and upon it is said to rest a sapphire that can grant any wish. A group of heroes seeking the sapphire arrive to blaze a trail through the unexplored island, but a great many adventures await them first.
