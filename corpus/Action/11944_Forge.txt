In Forge, a malicious being named The Devourer has swallowed the great pantheon of gods. Seeking escape, the trapped gods have deceptively turned great warriors into zealous adherents and placed them on a faceless world called Forge, where every champion's death feeds the immortals power. Choosing one of five unique warrior classes, the player must battle head-to-head against others in a bid to free their god from the clutches of The Devourer. Armed with a set of powerful and unique abilities as well as a mystical and deadly ally, each warrior must overcome the varied challenges of Forge where every victory is a sacrifice and every sacrifice brings them one step closer to freedom.
