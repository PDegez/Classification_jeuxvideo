Sinjid is falsely arrested for murdering Fujin, and is sentenced to seven years in prison while the real killer remains free. His captor, Lord Masaru, states that the Imperial Empire is at war with the Shogun, and that they need someone skilled enough to have killed the greatest Shinobi to fight the war for them. He promises that Sinjid will be pardoned for his alleged crimes if he cooperates with him, and he sets off on his quest to kill the Shogun's warlords and find his master's true killer. He receives assistance from Scout Eri, a scout assigned with giving him tactical information so he knows what he's going up against.
