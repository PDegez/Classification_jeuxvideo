An intergalactic pinball game, Plunderball is a three-layer pinball simulation which combines the thrill of an action game with the depth of an adventure game. The game tells a background story through short video clips that play whenever the ball gets trapped. The story combines a futuristic space warfare theme with a pirate adventure story line. You are a space pirate who has been secretly courting Princess Sarina of Cayden. On the journey to ask her father, Clanlord Braith, for the Princess's hand in marriage, you discover that she has been kidnapped by Cayden's arch-enemy Scorpion. The Clanlord promises his kingdom to the one who rescues his beloved daughter, sending you on a perilous journey through uncharted space to Steeleye's heavily armed armada.
