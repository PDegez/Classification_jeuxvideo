Years after DinoHunt Corp. discovered their dinosaur planet, business in the hunting division has been severely reduced. Not many people want to hunt dinosaurs anymore, and the more interested clients have been, well.......eaten. So the company decides to bring the dinosaurs to the earth colonies as a traveling zoo to make some much needed profit and hopefully build some interest in the hunting division. After several successful trips, one of the dinosaur transport ships, DinoCorp VII, was overrun by its saurian occupants and crashed on the outskirts of a more remote earth colony. The player chooses between playing as an agent hired to eradicate the dinosaurs, or as a rampaging dinosaur bent on eating every living thing.
