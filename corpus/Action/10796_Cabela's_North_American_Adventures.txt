Bring your A-game on this hunt - you're on camera. Your search for trophy game is captured on film as an expert cameraman follows you on your adventure. It's hunting taken to the extreme with record-class opportunities in situations meant only for the pros. To make the hunt even more challenging, you not only have to wait for the right gun or bow shot opportunity; you must make sure the cameraman perfectly frames the action. You'll hunt more than 30 game species across 10 North American regions from Alaska to Mexico. Use cover and stealth to close the distance on elusive trophies, and expert duck calling in an action-packed mallard hunt. When your trophy's down, relive the moment by watching an exciting 30-second video of the hunt's highlights. The game also features arcade-style shooting galleries where you can take on friends and family in head-to-head multiplayer or go on a target-rich prairie-dog shoot. For the first time in a hunting game (Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions), players can compete in four-person online multiplayer for bragging rights in fast-paced hunting action.
