Platypus by Idigicon and Retro64 is a classic side-scrolling shooter. You're using your little space craft to blast away enemy ships and you can get additional weapon upgrades for a certain ammount of time by shooting several enemy formations. The graphics in the game are quite remarkable, never seen on any other game. The visuals are rendered so that they are looking like clay. There are four different worlds with 20 levels each with their own enemies and themes. Another interesting thing is that many famous composers from the software and video game business have provided the music for the game.
