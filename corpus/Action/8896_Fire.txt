People jump out of a burning building and fall down to get rescued. The player, controlling two men carrying a life net, must bounce the people off the life net to get them to the ambulance on the other side of the screen. If the two men catch a person, the player earns a point; people who have been caught bounce and must be caught again. People fall at different speeds depending on where they are. As time passes, more people will jump from the burning building, and they will eventually fall faster. If the two men miss one of the falling people, the person gets injured and runs away, and the player receives a miss. If the player reaches 200 and 500 points, any misses they have will be removed, and the people will freeze to make it easy to get them before they continue falling. The player receives a Game Over when they have three misses. In Game B, there are two ways to escape from the burning building, so making the game harder.
