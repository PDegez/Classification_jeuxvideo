The game opening quickly introduces us to Jurio and Chris, two teenagers who are just about old enough to set on the pilgrimage to five shrines, thus proving to themselves, in a traditional way to their village, that they have become adults. But that is far from their final goal as their task will become much bigger and their quest, which began as a journey of exploration, truly a daring one, as they will set out to explore the world of Tirasweel to stop the Raual Wave destroying everything in its path and uncover the identity of the Moonlight Witch who predicted this.
