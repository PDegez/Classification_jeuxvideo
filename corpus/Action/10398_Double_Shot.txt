BULLET-RIDDLED BARTENDING Throw yourself back into an alternative 80's, where gangs rule the streets but the party must go on. As a hard-as-nails bartender, it's your job to keep the drinks flowing and the bad guys off your turf. You have been entrusted with B.A.R.R - the latest and greatest in sentient drink preparation technology, and it's up to you to keep it out of the hands of those who would use it for far more nefarious purposes. Luckily, B.A.R.R is also equipped with the latest in anti-theft technology - you. BE THE 80'S ACTION HERO It's not enough to be good at mixing drinks, and just being able to take out a bad guy without breaking a sweat won't do the trick either - you'll need to be a wizard at both if you're going to keep B.A.R.R safe, keep the customers happy, and make sure you survive your shift long enough to spend all your hard earned money.
