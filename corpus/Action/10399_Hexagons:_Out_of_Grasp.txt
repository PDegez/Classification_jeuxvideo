"Hexagons: Out of Grasp" is a 2D shooter where you need to find keys to open gates and advance into the next level. You will have a handful of different enemies to fight while finding the keys. Nothing can be too hard when you have your reliable plastic wrap cannon though. With your cannon, and possibly a few allies down the road, you are sure to make it through the levels and escape the hexagon mothership.
