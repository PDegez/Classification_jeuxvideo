The Clucking Chickens, created by Sawyer Ique, are now on the greatest egg-catching challenge, so they can save the eggs that are falling down towards them to come all the way onto the basket to hold them all together to of course share with other chickens around their place after, all in a flocking fun arcade-style game to play, and even ruffle your feathers and cluck in happiness to catch some eggs.
