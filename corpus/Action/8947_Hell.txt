The concept that Hell overflows and demons rush forth to the realm of humanity, feasting upon the defenseless population, is as old as time itself. Stories conjured up as warnings for bad behavior, or early versions of entertainment, have depicted the demons of Hell rising forth and laying waste to lands that were previously powerful yet corrupt communities, only to be protected by selfless heroes that turn the tides of war back in their favor. Hell tells the story of the demons of Hell ransacking a mystical world full of swords and sorcery, and it is up to the player to take command, and turn the tides back on those demonic forces.
