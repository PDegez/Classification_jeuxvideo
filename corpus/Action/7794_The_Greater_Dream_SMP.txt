The War for L'Manberg Independence was an era of war between members of the Dream Team SMP. Wilbur Soot and TommyInnit had plans for a drug empire, which members of the Dream SMP thwarted. In response, Wilbur gathered a few of his friends and created a new independent nation, L'Manberg, seceding from the Dream SMP. In return, Dream declared war.
