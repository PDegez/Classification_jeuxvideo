War on Terror is a real-time strategy game in a modern setting. In the game three factions are waging war against one another. The Order wants to create a global utopia. To topple the current balance of power they employ guerrilla tactics. The World Forces are an alliance of the world's most powerful western countries such as the United States, Britain, France, Germany and Russia. The third faction is China. In the game you can compose your forces at the start of each mission. There is not in-game resource gathering and construction. It's possible to earn points during missions. This is done through killing enemies and completing sub missions. These points can be used to have new units sent in by helicopter. Units that survive longer gain experience and become powerful in combat. When a unit goes down there's still several seconds to get them back on their feet using a medic unit, but when they die it's permanent. The game features fog of war and thus focuses heavily on reconnaissance with fast or air units to explore the battlefield and locate the enemy. Each faction has it's own type of units in various categories, such as infantry, tanks and a special unit with more devastating attacks such as chemical gas or a nuclear strike.
