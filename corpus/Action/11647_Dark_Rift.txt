The cosmos is controlled by two Prime Elements, known as "Core" and "Dark". Each is possessed by a tyrant who is in perpetual search of the third element, the Light, which would grant its owner tremendous power. Sonork Nezom, the carrier of Core Element, has organized a fighting tournament, with Core Element itself being the prize. He hopes that the carrier of the Light Element will be among the participants. He plans then to strike and gain possession of all the elements at once. But Lord Demon Demitron, the carrier of the Dark Element, has other plans.
