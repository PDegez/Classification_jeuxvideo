Designed for Super Nintendo, this version of "Wolverine: Adamantium Rage" is a side-scrolling platformer/beat'em up which is, similar to, but different from the version released on the Sega Genesis. While using a computer at the X-Men mansion, Wolverine receives a mysterious message and coordinates directing him to Canada. Hoping to learn about his past, Wolverine battles his way through the Weapon X lab, rural Japan, Tokyo, a hallucinogenic nightmare, and Tokyo's Hellfire Club and its subterranean caverns. In addition to various robots/enemies, Wolverine must defeat the Destroyer Program, Tri-Fusion, Lady Deathstrike, Geist, Bloodscream, Cyber, Black Queen, Fugue, and the Great Beast. However, if he takes to long on a level, Elsie-Dee will find him blow both of them up, ending the game.
