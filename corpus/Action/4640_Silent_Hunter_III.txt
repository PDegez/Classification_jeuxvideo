In Silent Hunter III players take command of a German U-Boat (submarine), operating in the Atlantic Ocean during World War II. The player will lead a captain's career that begins in a year of their choice, from 1939 to 1944, assigned to the flotilla of their choice, which influences the player's initial base and submarine type. After these choices, the dynamic campaign takes over, and time progresses at a steady pace, while the player and the AI wage war against Britain and its allies both on the sea and under it.
