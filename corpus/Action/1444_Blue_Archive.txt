You awake as a "sensei", after seeing an unknown yet familiar girl in your dreams. You are tasked by the Vice President of the General Student Council of the sprawling academic city of Kivotos to find the GSC's missing president... who evidently foresaw your coming before her disappearance and established the Federal Investigation Club "Schale" for you to manage, and several tools you can use on your mission, most notably the strange tablet-PC-like device referred to as the "Shittim Chest" and its helpful AI companion, Arona. With this in hand, you begin recruiting students from Kivotos' many, many schools to aid you in helping restore normalcy to Kivotos generally, and along the way, hopefully find a clue as to what happened to the GSC President... and what, precisely, she wanted you to do.
