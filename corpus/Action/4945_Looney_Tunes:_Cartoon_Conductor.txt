The game starts with Bugs Bunny standing in front of a stage. Bugs explains that the Tasmanian Devil destroyed the classical music in some old Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoons, so it's up to the player to conduct a new orchestra to refill the Looney Tunes cartoon background music. Bugs then will teach the player about how to conduct the orchestra.
