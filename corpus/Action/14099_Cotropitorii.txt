The story starts in 1988. During Ceausescu's reign Romania had been brimming with apathy and fear. To give hope to his people, as well as follow through with his own diabolical plan, Ceausescu started building up his army. In 1989 a war broke out. Not between Romania and its neighbors, but between Romania and the United States of America. Fueled by the hate Romanians have toward Americans, gained during the Second World War when the Americans failed to protect Romania from Stalin, millions of them enlisted in the military. Today, the war rages on as more and more of US territory is trampled by Romanian tanks. In the winter of 2024 the Romanian air force reduced the United States Air Force to less than 10% of its former power, leaving the remaining US Army only with tank and infantry support. In the summer of 2025 one million troops and two hundred thousand tanks were ready to take the battle even further as Ceausescu's plan to overtake Texas was en-route. You are part of an elite few, the Romanian Mountain Hunters, the highly-trained special forces of Ceausescu's army. You are here to hunt down and destroy Americans, wherever they may be. Your immediate task is to infiltrate enemy territory and deal a swift blow to the American infantry. This has turned into guerrilla warfare, as the streets of once proud American cities are now ruins under Romanian gunfire.
