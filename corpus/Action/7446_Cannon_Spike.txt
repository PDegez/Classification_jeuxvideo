Somewhat similar in style to Smash T.V. in gameplay, you do battle in ten levels, containing two to four areas each. Players can choose from a variety of characters including Mega man from the Mega man series, Knight Arthur from Ghost 'N' Goblins series, Charlie and Cammy, both from Street Fighter series and B. B. Hood from Darkstalkers . The different characters use slightly different attacks but each share the setup of one regular ranged attack and one powerful ditto as well as one regular and one powerful melee attack.
