It's an all or nothing battle royale for the coveted Stake emblem. Whoever achieves this emblem will supposedly receive a lifetime of riches, fame, and respect. Eight of the most extraordinarily powerful fighters are pitted against each other, pants or not, and are expected to know exactly what they're supposed to do. Widely considered to be the hardest Xbox game in existence as well as one of the worst games of all-time, any player who can actually get through this game should receive a lifetime of respect. Or pity. Or both.
