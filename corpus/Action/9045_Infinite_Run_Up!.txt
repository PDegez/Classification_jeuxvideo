Plot is playing as Dasher Schmerlo as he is in trapped in a reality of running infinitely. Dodge the meteors and get the boosts and beat your high score. There is many game modes such as Freedom Mode purely a practice mode where you can never do and not gain score. Falling does not kill you in this mode Hardcore Mode is based on the originally PC Mode and in this mode the game is much more difficult such as the meteors are increased more scythe sticks start to fall. Boosters are less common and the wall of death moves much faster.
