Brimo is a lighthearted arcade game where you score points by getting the plants to bloom and spread their seeds. Don't let the plants dry out, or you'll lose health. Make sure to always refill your water at the Brimo pump station while watching out for UFOs and angry lawnmowers before they destroy your plants. Designed for the 2021 GoGodot Game Jam by Mama Makes Games with a voice over cameo by Brimstone.
