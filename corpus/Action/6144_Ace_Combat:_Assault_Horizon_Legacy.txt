The story concerns a rebel coup during a pinnacle treaty signing where the player takes the role of Phoenix in Scarface Squadron and must quell the uprising in a series of aerial, air-to-ground, and air-to-sea battles along with escort missions. The game takes place in the same fictional world as previous entries concerning the Osean Federation, the Union of Yuktobanian Republics, and the Federal Republic of Erusea. Aircraft in the game are both real, officially licensed planes, and fictional, and can be purchased and upgraded through progression of the story mode. The game features voice acting in every area including dialog during combat, mission briefings, and story cutscenes. As the story progresses and more planes are purchased, players must use strategic thinking in selecting their aircraft and weapons, perhaps choosing to sacrifice armor for mobility, mobility for speed, long-range missiles over air-to-ground missiles, and the like.
