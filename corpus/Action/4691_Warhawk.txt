Warhawk, a remake of the PSX launch title of the same name, is a multiplayer-only futuristic combat game, in the style of the Battlefield or Tribes series. Combat focuses on up to 32 players piloting Warhawks (the game's Harrier-jet-like aircraft) in large-scale acrobatic dogfights using the motion-sensing features of the SIXAXIS controller. However, at any time, players can park their aircraft and continue the fight on foot (using firearms, grenades, knives and surface-to-air missile launchers) or in a ground-based vehicle (jeeps, tanks and a variety of turrets). Supported game modes at release include classic deathmatch, team deathmatch, capture-the-flag, and a zone-based territory capture mode.
