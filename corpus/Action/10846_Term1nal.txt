You are contracted by a mysterious woman to infiltrate the offices of STRIDE Industries - the world's most successful (and well-guarded) data security and robotics firm on the planet. Getting the information you need from STRIDE can only be done by taking over the controls of a temperamentally experimental new robot model. Operating her remotely, you're able to use this robot to sneak past STRIDE security, hack terminals, unlock doors, and maybe even unlock something even more important: the truth.
