When Milk (Penelope Pitstop) is kidnapped, players have to explore the cosmos to rescue her. This game is a mixture of a graphic adventure and a racing game. In the adventure segments, players travel to different planets where they talk with people and solve puzzles using a point-and-click interface. Periodically, players will need to race to progress; these scenes feature a behind-the-car perspective as players try to get first place in high-speed chases.
