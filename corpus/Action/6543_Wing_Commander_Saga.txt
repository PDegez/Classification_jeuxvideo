The conflict between Earth and Kilrah is drawing to a close, and in spite of new fighters, carriers, and technology joining the Fleet, the war effort is not going well. Every day, more news of fresh defeats and losses make their way around the fleet. As mighty as the Confed forces are, they face a foe which seems invincible, for every Kilrathi fighter and warship destroyed, 10 others take their place. Humanity's only hope lies in a desperate plan, the last ditch effort to bring this decades long conflict to an end.
