Naruto Shippuden: Gekitou Ninja Taisen EX 2 is the sixth installment of the popular Naruto Ninja Taisen (aka. Clash of Ninja) series. This is the first Naruto Shippuden game to feature time-skip Sasuke Uchiha as a playable character. New characters include Sasuke Uchiha, Sai, Yamato, and the return of others like Tsunade, Orochimaru, and Jiraiya. Characters such as Hinata Hyuuga, Kiba Inuzuka, Shino Aburame, Chouji Akimichi, Shikamaru Nara and Asuma Sarutobi will be returning in their time-skip forms. Two new features, "Danger Zones" and a hand seal function are included in the game. The first, "Danger Zones", are hazards on stages that can hurt the player's character when encountered (for example, spikes on cliff walls). The second feature included is a new hand seal mechanism, which can be used by the player to raise their character's attack power or health.
