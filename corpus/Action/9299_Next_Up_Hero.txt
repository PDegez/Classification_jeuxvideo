The Ceaseless Dirge has attacked. Fight as the Legendary Heroes against tough-as-nails mechs and monsters. Every time you die, you leave behind an Echo who can be raised by the next player. The more heroes who die, the stronger we all become, until we win together. Are you a Hero? Good. You're up next.
