The game is set in a gas station, where a leaky pipe is dripping oil. A station employee must collect these drops in a bucket and dump them into his boss's oil drum so that he may take them to the cars waiting beside the defunct gas pumps. He also needs to be quick, as the dripping oil is right above flammable sources that will cause a major fire if the droplets made contact with them. The bucket can hold three drops of oil. For every drop of oil the employee catches, he receives a point. He earns a point for dumping one drop of oil into the oil drum, two points for dumping two drops, and five points for dumping three drops. As the game progresses, the oil will drip faster. If a drop is missed, if the bucket overflows, or if the employee dumps his bucket on a customer instead of in his boss's drum, he loses one of four lives.
