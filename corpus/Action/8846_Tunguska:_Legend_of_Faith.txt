Tunguska is a 3D action game in which you play Jack Riley, an inter-dimensional traveler. The main objective is to decode the secret of the Castle of the Order of Tunguska, where he finds himself after he's accidentally caught by the 'powers of darkness'. The game involves tactical real-time fighting, in which you advance by a skill/level based system, as well as a limited amount of puzzle-solving. When you decode the secret of the Castle, the powers of darkness will be defeated and Jack is free to continue his journey.
