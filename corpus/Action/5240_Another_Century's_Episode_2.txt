Tak Kepford and Marina Carson are test pilots for a series of mecha called Arks. Following a test run of a new Ark series mecha prototype dubbed Gun Ark, the UCE base where the test was carried out is attacked by another group, attempting to steal a prototype Gundam also being tested there. During the attack, Marina is killed, Gun Ark is destroyed, and the Gundam prototype is stolen. Tak joins up with the Albion corps to help track down the stolen machine, but soon winds up involved in something much larger.
