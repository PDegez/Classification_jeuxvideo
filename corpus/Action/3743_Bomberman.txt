Bomberman is a robot engaged in the production of bomb manufacturing. Along with other robots, he is forced to work in an underground compound by evil forces. Bomberman found this life to be dreary and unbearable. One day Bomberman heard a rumor that if a robot were to escape the underground compound, then that robot will be able to become a human being. Bomberman decided to take a chance by trying to escape to the surface of the outside world. Escaping the compound however is no easy task, when every enemy is alerted about Bomberman's betrayal. The only defense Bomberman has against the hoards of enemies are the bombs he helped manufacture. Will Bomberman escape to the surface? Or will he die trying?
