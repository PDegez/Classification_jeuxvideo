Many years have passed since the Assault Knight and Omni war. Both factions have ravaged the galaxy time and again. But now they have finally come to a truce, over the infighting. But there are still a lot of tensions stirring behind the scenes. You as the player take on the role of a lone mercenary who has been kicked out of the Assault Knights militia over something they did not do, but they needed a scapegoat for something horrendous that happened. And that scapegoat is you. After being formally discharged from the military, and being stripped of all badges, awards, and honors the player gets a message from one of the admirals in the militia. It says that your best friend has suddenly died in battle and that he left you something in his will, along with a letter to you. After reading the will and devastating letter from your friend, you find that he left you a large ship in a space junkyard near a moon, but it is broken down and in dire need of repair. On the bright side, the ship is gigantic. The player has to take some time to repair the ship using simple puzzle gameplay to perform minor repairs. You will find parts from the other ships in the junkyard to help you customize your ship, and get it working. While the ship itself isn't in working order, a small drop ship may be found in the docking bay. This will be used by the player to collect the parts needed for repairs and customization. The dropship has a few lasers and some mediocre mining tools. This will be where you start learning the basics of the game. There will be many more cool elements at your disposal as time goes on.
