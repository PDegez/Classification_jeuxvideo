Hover. has three mazes that resemble a medieval castle, a futuristic city, and a sewer. Each maze has its own unique texture maps, music theme, and spawn locations. For each level, Hover. will cycle through each of the three mazes, or randomly select one (if that option is set). The goal of each level is to capture all of the blue flags hidden throughout the level (playing as the red hovercraft), before the enemy (blue) team collects all of the red flags. A game starts with having 3 red flags and 3 blue flags in each level, but will go up to 5 flags of each color in higher levels. Higher levels are also have more enemy hover crafts and a more difficult AI. There are also orbs scattered throughout each maze that will give the player a collectible item or a status effect (such as increasing or decreasing the hovercraft's speed, or temporarily giving an invincibility shield). The collectible items are Wall (which can be placed to temporarily impede the enemy hovercraft), Spring (to make the player's hovercraft jump really high), and Cloak (to temporarily hide the player's hovercraft from the enemy team).
