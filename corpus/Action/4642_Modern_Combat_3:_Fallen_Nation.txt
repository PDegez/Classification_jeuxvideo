In the backstory to the game, terrorists from North Korea, Pakistan and Russia have formed an alliance called the K.P.R. Alliance. Led by General Popovich (a supporting antagonist from Black Pegasus), K.P.R. have declared war on the United States. After defeating the US defense apparatus, K.P.R. invaded US territory and deployed several WMDs in US cities.
