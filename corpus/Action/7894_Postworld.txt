POSTWORLD is a hardcore rogue-like action RPG in which you explore a dangerous post-apocalyptic wasteland and attempt to take revenge on the nefarious corporation that subjected you to inhumane experiments. The post-apocalyptic game world of POSTWORLD is a very tough and violent place to survive in. Not only do you need to take care of your thirst, hunger and sleep needs, but you also have to deal with rage-filled enemies who will continue to fight even when being burned alive or having body parts ripped off. To survive long enough to wreak your revenge on the corporation that experimented on you then you'll have to scavenge for resources, interact with 3 different factions, learn new skills and use a mixture of melee weapons, guns, shields and explosives to take down enemies. You'll need to be tactical during combat, assessing your enemies weak spots and using them to your advantage. It's a great looking game, that looks set to make the fight for survival in its wasteland a tough and high stakes experience, with permadeath, procedurally generated level design and a realistic inventory system (no bottomless pockets). There are even plans to introduce mutated animals (such as lizards and cows) and the ability to replace limbs that you lose with augmented ones. Survival may be tough in the world of POSTWORLD, but it also looks like it'll be a whole lot of fun.
