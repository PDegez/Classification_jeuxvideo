Taro Yamada is an average young man who lives in the suburbs with his parents, until one day a strange package containing a superhero costume is delivered to his house by mistake. He puts the costume on to entertain some guests, but soon discovers that it really does give him superpowers when he accidentally sends his father flying through a wall. The suit turns out to be the Rent A Hero Combat Armor, which is designed to allow anyone to become a hero. He's allowed to keep it, but there's just one catch: He has to pay the rental fees. Of course SECA, the company that makes the armor, also provides jobs to their renters, and they pay well if you're good enough.
