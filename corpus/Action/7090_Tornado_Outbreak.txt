Zephyr's Mission Log: First Entry Captain Nimbus has decided that it is time for him to step down and hand the reins of the squad to Zephyr, a young Wind Warrior. Zephyr, and his friends are all Wind Warriors and it's their universal task to create atmospheres on lifeless planets.Becoming Captain was going to be the most exciting event of Zephyr's life, but then he met Omegaton. He was the greatest hero of a strange backwards dimension, which he described as an anti-matter universe, whatever that is. Omegaton's enemies joined forces and overpowered him. Omegaton was stripped of his six orbs of power and banished to our universe. He would've perished if the Wind Warriors didn't find him. Nimbus realized that Omegaton needed to absorb positive matter in order to maintain atomic cohesion in our universe. Without them, Omegaton couldn't survive. With the approval of Nimbus, Zephyr gave his first order. They would find Omegaton's orbs and help him return home.Their search took them to Earth, and to their first big problem: its giant sun. Its radiation is deadly to their kind, but Omegaton assured them he had a solution. Omegaton gave them the "lightweight object amalgam device," or L.O.A.D. STARR. The L.O.A.D. STARR can locate the orbs Omegaton needs and give the Wind Warriors cover from the sun's deadly UV rays. It can also collect and hold the Fire Flyers. The Fire Flyers? They're agents of the enemies of Omegaton, and now the Wind Warriors' enemies too.
