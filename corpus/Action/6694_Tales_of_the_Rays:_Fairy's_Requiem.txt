The ancient Asgard Empire was founded 1200 years ago, but eventually splintered into the Kingdom of Sellund and the Bifrost Empire. When the long war between the two powers finally ended, many hoped the peace would last. However, conflict over the chiral particles that power the world led to the mirrage wars, which wiped all nations but Sellund off the map. After overcoming a great many obstacles, Ix and Mileena managed to exoflect all of their lost world. In the process, Ix ended up trapped in a mirrage prison, but was, in time, successfully rescued by his companions. Meanwhile, Emperor Demetrius's use of nexuses to revive the Asgard Empire does nothing to calm the turbulent world. The Emperor's plans remain unclear, but he seems willing to use any means to achieve them. In the midst of it all, Bifrost's Princess Mercuria vows to eradicate mirrists and mirrites in order to avenge her slain brother. In order to atone for the crimes that another version of Mileena had committed, Mileena and Ix will stand against Mercuria and the Asgard Empire.
