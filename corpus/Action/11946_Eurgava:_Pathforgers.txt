The Naga Cult managed to corrupt High Naga Zalnaos. Their victory was quickly followed by their growing power and influence. On the other side, the Pilgrim finally found a way to prevent the Naga Cult from corrupting the rest of the nagas: Sacrificing members of their own to become a herald of said naga. The war between the Naga Cult and the Pilgrims eventually turned into a race about corrupting or protecting the remaining nagas as many as they can, for only the victor gets to decide the fate of the entire Shartemen. Today, in year 256, people started seeing those monstrous pathforgers among the Naga Cult warbands. They must be up to something.
