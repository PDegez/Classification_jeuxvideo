The "Land Of Mines" video game project was originally started around the year 2005, and was in BETA state. Within 2018 the main original graphics (which have a retro style design) was still used, and the game was updated; Re-programmed and re-directed, as well as project take over by; "MetalManGames", for the present era. This game also includes a old pre-2005 composition from the composer known as "Leo Louis", which was composed for someone else's video game originally, but was never used in that particular video game. Later was used within the "Land Of Mines" video game as the main title soundtrack. To play the video game (Land Of Mines) the player of the video game shall press on the; "Dark gray squares", by trying to make a random guess of to where the green flag might be hidden. If the player gets a "blank" (light gray square area), the player keeps playing the game, if the player gets a "green flag" the player wins the game, but if the player gets a "red mine" it is game over. The player also has a time limit in which the player needs to beat the video game without running out of time.
