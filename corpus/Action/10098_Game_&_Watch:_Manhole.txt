The main character has to stop pedestrians from falling into holes that lead to the sewers below. To do this, he uses a manhole cover, which fills in the holes long enough for the people to pass. The player earns a point for every pedestrian who travels across a manhole cover. As the game progresses, the pedestrians will move faster. More of them appear in Game B. If a pedestrian falls into the water, the player gets a miss. If the player reaches 300 points without any misses, the points will be worth double until the player does get a miss. If the player has any misses at said score, every miss will be cleared instead. When the player gets three misses, they receive a Game Over.
