Pinball FX is a pinball simulator. The core package contains three separate tables: Speed Machine (with a street racing theme), Extreme (with a skateboarding, urban motif), and Agents (a Bond riff). Other boards are promised through Xbox Live downloads, with so far a single board available entitled Buccaneer, with a pirate theme. Two players can compete simultaneously on Xbox Live, and support is available for controlling the boards through the Xbox Camera.
