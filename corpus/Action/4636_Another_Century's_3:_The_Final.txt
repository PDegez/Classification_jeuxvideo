A few years after the events of A.C.E. 2, a strange meteor lands near the home of average high-school student Barrel Orland. Unidentified life forms begin to attack, and he meets a girl named Fei Roshenande, pilot of a giant robot called the Exbrau. Reluctantly, he joins Fei and becomes a pilot for the Earth Federation, fighting the invading aliens in hopes of stopping their assault on his planet.
