It's the first time in Naruto game history that two completely different battle modes are combined into one game. While most players are used to the one to one fights, a new battle mode is introduced in this game and it gives you the pleasure of mowing down regiments of opponents in the battle field. Feeling particularly powerful? Feeling you can take on the world? Try this out. At the end of every stage, you will meet a boss. Deal with him/her in an one to one basis. A total of 35 characters are going to show up in the battle roster. First time in a Naruto game, you can join in a team with a partner and get involved in tag battles. With a pair to control, you can launch an array of combined attacks. Team up with different people and try out their various skills. Scenes are rendered in 3D and an original story is written for the game. Meet the characters in in their 3D forms fight them and adventure with them.
