In the world of Tir Na Nog, people called mirrists wield magical weapons called mirrages. This world was saved from the brink of destruction by mirrists Ix and Mileena and a band of otherworldly heroes, but the reward for their efforts was still more tragedy. Due to the mirrists' power, much of the world was left encased in a mass of crystal centered on the capital city of Sellund, with Ix among the victims. With the spreading crystals threatening the rest of the world, Mileena is considered a pariah, her mirristry blamed for setting the world's destruction in motion. To escape, Mileena uses her mirrage to create a new base of operations in which she, the mirrite Kocis, and their companions can hide. From there, they set about trying to rescue Ix from his mirrage prison.
