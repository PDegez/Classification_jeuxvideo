Saturn Bomberman Fight!. uses the basic formula of previous titles of the franchise like Saturn Bomberman, but strays from it in some aspects. It uses an isometric perspective in a 3D-polygon environment, where up to four characters of the Bomberman universe can fight each other in battles, either controlled by the AI or a human companion. Players start out with the ability to jump over obstacles and throw bombs without having to collect powerups first, and there is also a health meter, so it's possible to survive more than one bomb blast. A brown horse is the only mount available, it can move quickly, absorb damage, and swallow bombs. Aside from the core battle mode, there is a story mode (which is rather similar to the battle mode in that it consists of matches against computer players) and a survival mode which goes endlessly on until the player is defeated.
