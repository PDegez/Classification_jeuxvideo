This sequel to Triplane Turmoil adds two new plane types and multiple gameplay features. The game offers six single player campaigns and over 30 multiplayer maps to compete against human and computer opponents. The game is still a a fast-paced sidescrolling 2D shooter like its predecessor, but all objects are now three-dimensional and the background has an added depth to it. The solo campaigns now have all-new intelligence missions where the player must photograph important enemy facilities.
