The Second World War has drawn to a close, but people are getting sick and turning horrendously violent. The cause is an unknown virus brought through the immigration center at Ellis island. The disease spirals out of control and takes over entire cities. Marine Micheal Pyeatt is dispatched to New York City to hold a key position. His position gets overrun, but he miraculously survives and is left in a coma. When he wakes up, he finds himself in a small settlement of survivors who are counting on him to lead them in their struggle to survive.
