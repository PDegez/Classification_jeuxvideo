"Manimal Sanctuary" is a virtual reality lurking simulator that uses mobile technology to enable every player's ultimate fantasy: to play a creature -- part coral reef, part Cthulu -- who consumes human emotions. Set on the Toronto Islands after the rest of the world is devoured by gibbering monstrosities, you eavesdrop on the survivors and their everyday dramas involving things like bad potato crops and graffiti tags. And if those emotions aren't delicious enough, you can compel them to tell devastating secrets.
