Hello Offroaders. The new open world off-road driving simulator is here. It's time to get Off The Road. Drive your rig on the hills of your own open world, get into a boat and explore islands, pick a helicopter and fly freely to the top of the mountains or just walk around if you need a peaceful hike it's up to you. Beat challenges to earn money and upgrade your car. Make it stronger, faster, look more awesome.
