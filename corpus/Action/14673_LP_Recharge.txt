Set in the near future, LP Recharge centers on a world where all of the world's natural resources has been taken over by an elite group and it's up to players to bring clean, sustainable energy back to the environment to save humanity. The game encourages players to work together to achieve goals that one player can't reach on their own and this mirrors the idea that it's gonna take all of us working together as people to address energy issues and solve some of these problems before they turn into crisis," said Shinoda.
