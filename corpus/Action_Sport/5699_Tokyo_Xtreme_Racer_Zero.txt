Tokyo Xtreme Racer Zero is a one or two player racing game based on illegal street racing around the streets of Tokyo. The game starts by giving the player $15000 so that they can buy their car. There are three types of car; Class A has the most powerful engines; Class B has mid range engines but are better balanced; and Class C cars lack power but have better handling. Needless to say the cash the payer starts with is sufficient for the lower cars in each group, players need to win cash if they are to upgrade.
