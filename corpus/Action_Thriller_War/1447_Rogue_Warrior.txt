It is November 1986. Richard "Demo Dick" Marcinko is sent into North Korea along with two other Navy SEALs. They are on a mission to find out if North Korea is in possession of ICBM missiles. Shortly after touching ground, Marcinko's team is killed and he must finish the mission on his own without any outside assistance.
