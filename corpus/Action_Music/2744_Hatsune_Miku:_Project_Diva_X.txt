Help Miku and her friends sing and dance their way through five Clouds that comprise their world. Each Cloud has its own unique aura, Classic, Cool, Cute, Elegant and Quirky that will offer different challenges for players to fulfill. The auras of the 30 new and classic songs they perform, and the nearly 300 modules (costumes) they'll wear, will have an important impact on the many different challenges.
