Three hundred years have passed since the Great War consumed the planet. Three hundred years since the human race ate hungrily of mother earth, squandering resources that could have carried them forward for millennia. In the heat of the sun, there is an unsettling, inescapable truth: man has fallen from his throne. Humanity now lives among the ruins left by a century of conflict, but from the wrecked steel of the past they will forge their own future. Lighter-than-air technology has inspired intrepid pioneers to take to the skies in search of trade and resources to support their towns and families. Enterprising craftsmen fashion elaborate machines out of scavenged scraps. The desperate and ruthless take what they can by force. Despite all that was lost, a renewed passion for invention has emerged, along with a deep respect for the fragility of life. Explorers and philosophers travel in search of forgotten knowledge now scattered beneath the wastes. The survivors are inventors, pilots, captains, craftsmen, adventurers, fighters, privateers, merchants, engineers, farmers and scholars. They herald a new age for humanity: an age of rebirth.
