Project Numen is performed in the genre action / RPG and promises a number of beneficial differences from competing products: original game world, fascinating plot, innovative elements of game mechanics and competently worked combat system. The game takes place in the stunningly beautiful world of ancient Greece, where mythical creatures, legendary heroes and ambitious gods came to life. On the broad coasts and stony plains are many politicians and villages, full of both hostile and friendly residents with a couple of other quests for the soul. And on top of this idyllic imperiously look immortal Olympians. Immortals, but not at all impassive, they argued among themselves, who can rightfully be called the most powerful in the pantheon. There was a wise decision to avoid civil strife: the god who will train the most powerful hero from a sort of the human will win. This task falls on the player's shoulders. The selection of one of the three classes of the character (magician, warrior, hunter) follows the selection of the patron god (three for each of the classes). From these decisions depends everything that will happen next. Divine mentors are characterized by bonuses, receptions, talents and abilities that you can get from them. The style of the game, quests and secret locations also vary depending on the deity. The character should perform rituals and rituals. Often there are meetings with heroes-competitors - usually on a specially provided Arena. Sometimes heroes can be grouped together for the joint passage of particularly difficult quests (temporary truce of competitors is very helpful when you need to lime a dangerous enemy). Numen will cast a dark enemy against the player, including Cerberus, Gorgon Medusa, Charon, Cyclops, Centaurs, Nubians - We'll have to arm ourselves thoroughly, otherwise we will not be able to cope with the enemy. Fortunately, the best weapons can always be bought at auctions - bargaining is still as relevant.
