A nice game with up to four cooperative players exploring dungeons and fighting monsters from a top-view perspective. The four characters that could be played included: - Thyla the Valkarie (female human sword warrior in blue) - Thor the Warrior (male human axe warrior in red) - Merlin the wizard (male human magic-user in yellow) - Questor the Elf (male elf archer in green) Each player's character has different strengths and weaknesses. The players collect food, potions, and treasure in return for points, health, magic and power-ups.
