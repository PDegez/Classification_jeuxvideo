The town of Caldera is in deep trouble. The Fortress of Crystal, the last haven of the Inquisition and the Old Empire, harbors a mysterious cave that may protect it from the assault of the Titans. Luckily, two of the Titans began fighting each other, which gives the Inquisition time to coordinate their activities on the land. However, a sea monster known as Kraken attacks and destroys their ships at sea. Pirates roaming about prevent supplies from being delivered to the fortress. In this troublesome time, the hero is sent on a quest to find a legendary treasure and perhaps figure out a way to destroy the Titans.
