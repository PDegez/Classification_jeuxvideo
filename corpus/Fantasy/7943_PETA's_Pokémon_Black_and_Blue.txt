In this game parody of the famous "Pokemon" franchise, Pikachu and friends set out to the revenge against demented trainers after generations of violence and abuse. According to PETA, keeping Pokemon in pokeballs to send them out in battles, is like chaining up elephants in train carts to send them in circuses.
