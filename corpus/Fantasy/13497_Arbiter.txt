For centuries, the world has been filled with demonic spirits known as Ethers and Umbras these two races have been at war. One day, two spirits Dove and Raven chose to help the humans, and gave one of them the power to transform into a spirit himself. This human was known as the Arbiter, and his job was to defeat and seal more dangerous spirits within himself. But the Greater Spirits did not fear the Arbiter's judgement. Arbiter was killed by a spirit known only as The Grey and the spirits sealed by the Arbiters of the past were released back into the world, free to cause havoc once again. In his final moments, the Arbiter passed his powers onto his successor, Ashe, a boy now faced with an impossible task.
