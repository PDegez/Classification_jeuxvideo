Once again, the player controls the main character of the series, the adventurer Adol Christin, on a new journey. Adol's ship has been attacked, and he loses his consciousness. After a while, he wakes up on a sea shore, rescued by the Rehda, elf-like people who live in a small village. Soon he becomes involved in a quest for mysterious treasure hidden somewhere on nearby islands, and has to face an ambitious empire officer who will not tolerate any rivals on his hunt.
