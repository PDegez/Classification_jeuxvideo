Guts, a swordsman formerly belonging to The Band of the Hawk, stumbles upon a disturbed town while wandering the wilderness with his companions Puck the elf and Casca, a traumatized woman whom he is trying to cure. He discovers that the town is victim to a deadly disease called the "Mandragora". He makes a deal with the ruler of the town to retrieve a cure, so his doctors can cure the people, and possibly Casca as well. But can Guts trust the Baron?
