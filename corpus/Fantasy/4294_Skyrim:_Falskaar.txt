For hundreds of years Falskaar has been inhabited by the Nords, though most of its history from before then is unknown. For the first time since the party's arrival in Falskaar almost 600 years ago a portal activates deep within the ruins of Mzubthand and the player steps through, arriving in Falskaar. They are denoted 'The Traveler', based on an old prophecy.
