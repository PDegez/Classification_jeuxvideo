Visit the grotesquely beautiful Cambion Drift in Heart of Deimos, the latest update in the ever expanding Origin System. Work with the Entrati to defend Deimos from the spreading Infestation that threatens to constrict the Heart of Deimos. The new Heart of Deimos Quest will see you following Mother, and her loyal (if a little damaged) servants Loid and Otak, into the sinister mystery that surrounds the Infested Moon of Deimos.
