The events of this game occur shortly after the ones described in the first installment of the series. Once again, the player takes the role of Raidou Kuzunoha the 14th, the youngest in the long line of devil summoners. It is the Taishou period (the 1920s) in Japan, and once again the Capital City is threatened by supernatural forces. Raidou works undercover at the Narumi Detective Agency, solving cases with mysterious backgrounds. It all begins when a young woman enters the office and asks the detective to find a missing man.
