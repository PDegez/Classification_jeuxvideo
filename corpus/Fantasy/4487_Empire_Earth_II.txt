Empire Earth II's expansive single player campaigns capture some of the key moments of human history. They begin with the origins of Korea, as the tribal cultures struggle for unity and independence from neighboring China. The focus then shifts to the 13th century and follows Prussia's eventual formation into powerful and influential Germanic nation. Finally, the player takes over America's forces, beginning at 1898 with America's entrance in the Spanish-American War, and ending with highly advanced technological warfare at the end of the 21st century. Empire Earth II also presents the option to choose sides during Turning Points scenarios (Battle of Normandy and the Battle of the Three Kingdoms), which illustrate two key conflicts in history.
