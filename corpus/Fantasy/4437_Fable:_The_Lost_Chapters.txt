Fable: The Lost Chapters is a version of Lionhead's Xbox-exclusive Fable, featuring enhancements to storyline and gameplay. The game expands the main plot of the original release, continuing it beyond the final confrontation as well as adding nine new areas and sixteen quests. A few characters from the earlier version participate in the storyline more actively and have their own quests. Additional content includes new buildings, monsters, weapons, spells, items, and armor. The protagonist also has more expressions and ways of communicating with people at his disposal. In the computer versions players have the ability to create their own tattoo designs and import them into the game.
