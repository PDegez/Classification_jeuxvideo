Zarok, an evil necromancer has returned from hiding while gathering his army of the undead; ready to wreak havoc on the citizens of fair Gallowmere. Unfortunately for his nefarious plot, the Hero of Gallowmere, Daniel Fortesque, has returned from the grave! With the assistance of a belligerent yet pocket sized Cyclops in his noggin, the one-eyed adventurer must thwart Zarok and his Undead Army's plots to finish their business of generally being a right pain for the god-fearing folk who would rather stagnate and become plump than become mindless pawns in Zarok's control.
