The evil Wizard Malkil has survived the first battle, but only in the form of four elementals. The bouncing knight Kuros sets out again to defeat him, this time with the aid of shop and inn-keepers, and four animal kings, the eagle, frog, dragon, and bear, for whom he must find the golden egg, golden fly, golden crown, and golden tankard, after which they will give passage to the realms of the elementals before the final confrontation on the mountain after assembling the four pieces of Ironsword.
