Ninja Gaiden Black is a re-release of Ninja Gaiden for the Xbox but with new content such as unlockable costumes, a mission mode, and more difficulty modes. Hard mode is unlocked right away if you have completed the original Ninja Gaiden and the saved file is present on your Xbox. Ninja Dog mode is also included for fans who felt the game on normal was too hard. This is unlocked by dying three consecutive times on the first chapter in normal mode. There are also two more levels of difficulty (very hard and master ninja), which are unlocked consecutively with the completion of the game on the previous difficulty setting.
