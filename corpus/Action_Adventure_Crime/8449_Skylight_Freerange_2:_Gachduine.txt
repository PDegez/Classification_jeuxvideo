The year is 2048. You are the leader of a group called the Gachduine, an organization unknown to the public of Nova Scotia. The Gachduine's goal is to take down the Cult of the Symbiote, a regulation group for the versatile, organism-altering biotechnology known as Skylight Symbiote. The Cult of the Symbiote's iron grip had slowly taken over Prince Edward Island, as well as New Brunswick after the Cult started a bloody civil war there in 2045. You have just returned from dismantling the Cult's influence in Newfoundland, and must now meet up the rest of the Gachduine to stop the Cult in Nova Scotia.
