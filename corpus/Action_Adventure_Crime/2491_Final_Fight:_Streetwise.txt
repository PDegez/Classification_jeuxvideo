Cody Travers was a hero in Metro City... a long time ago. He brought down the Mad Gear gang. But now he's just another boxing trainer. It's his younger brother Kyle that's the star of the streets. A rising underground pit-fighter, born from nothing, meaner than anyone. When Cody is kidnapped, and a new street drug sends Metro City spiraling into chaos, it's down to Kyle to bring the pain to the streets, to find out what's happened to his brother and to stop whoever's responsible for the chaos engulfing the city.
