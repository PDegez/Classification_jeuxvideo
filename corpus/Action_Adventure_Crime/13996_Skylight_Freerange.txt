The year is 2041, ten years after a nation-wide firestorm in Canada known as the Northern Burning. The destruction hit southern Manitoba the hardest and allowed the Neo De-Confederates, or NDC, to take over Winnipeg, renaming the city to Impossible, after a Skylight Symbiote monster they worshipped as god. Severin, the agency that caused the Northern Burning, had been completely destroyed over the past few years, save for one location in Portage la Prairie, Manitoba, under an abandoned pizza parlour.
