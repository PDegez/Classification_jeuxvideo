Onigiri is a free-to-play MMO action RPG set in a fantasy world where you can battle enemy monsters and bosses teamed up with NPCs or other players. At the very start you get to create your character which is a pre-set male or female whose appearance is slightly customizable. Kamigui, an evil god who carved a path of destruction for centuries has been sealed away by the goddess of the Sun, Amaterasu Oomikami. However, the seals were shattered and Kamigui has returned to finish what he started. The player takes a role of Oni, a young gal or lad, depending on the player's choice, whose peaceful world was disrupted by the resurrection of Kamigui, and the task of stopping him fell on you. The game utilizes basic real-time battle system which lets you perform a melee or ranged attack or use an equipped skill. During combat and by finishing quests your character levels up which lets you increase its stats such as strength, vitality, dexterity and the likes. You can also create stronger relationships with your partners which increase their power during battle.
