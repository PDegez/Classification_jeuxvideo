The protagonist, a resident shrine maiden Reimu Hakurei, returns from a training session in the mountains only to find the Hakurei Shrine overrun by a contingent of ghosts and youkai (demons). Excited at the opportunity to test her fledgling abilities, she takes the powerful Hakurei Yin-Yang Orbs and takes off on the back of her turtle Genjii to seek out the source of the invasion.
