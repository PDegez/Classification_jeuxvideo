A white creature named Kyubey has the power to grant girls any single wish. In exchange for that wish, however, they must become magical girls and fight against creatures known as Witches. A rumor soon begins to spread among magical girls that they can be saved from their duty by going to Kamihama City. Iroha Tamaki, a girl who had originally forgotten the wish she had made to become a magical girl, one day encounters a smaller Kyubey and remembers that she made a wish to cure her younger sister Ui of her illness. Realising that Ui has become missing somehow, Iroha travels to Kamihama City in order to find answers, encountering many other magical girls along the way.
