You, the courier, were drawn to an abandoned Brotherhood of Steel bunker by a mysterious signal. Next thing you know, you've been knocked out. You wake up with a slave collar around your neck and receive a message from the missing Brotherhood of Steel elder, Father Elijah. He wants you, along with others who have been captured, to search for the Sierra Madre treasure - or die trying.
