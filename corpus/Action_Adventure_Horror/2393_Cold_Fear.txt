A team from the Coast Guard boards a nameless Russian Whaler lost in a storm. Little do they know that a team of CIA operatives tried to do the same shortly before, all of them ending up dead. Within minutes, the entire Coast Guard team shares their fate, except one person, veteran USCG Tom Hansen. Now it's up to him to discover which kind of creatures wiped out his mates. Are there any survivors? What happened aboard this vessel? How does its recent visit to the Russian scientific drilling platform "Star of Sakhalin" fit in?
