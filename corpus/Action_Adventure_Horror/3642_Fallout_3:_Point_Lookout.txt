Point Lookout is the fourth downloadable expansion for Fallout 3, and takes the player to the misty swampland along the coast of Maryland. The town of Point Lookout is a unique area in the Fallout universe, in that it has not been directly hit by bombs or affected the subsequent warfare. Instead, it has suffered decades of neglect and isolation.
