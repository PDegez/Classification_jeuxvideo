NARC is an in-depth, third-person action/shooter and remake of the 1988 arcade classic set against a stylized modern-day backdrop of the War on Drugs. Playing as dual characters, narcotics officer Jack Forzenski and DEA agent Marcus Hill, in the elite NARC squad you must rid the world of the powerful international K.R.A.K. drug cartel and their mysterious new deadly drug called Liquid Soul. Find them, bust them and/or kill them to bring justice to action-packed, crime-ridden, drug-infested streets - or turn crooked and help them. In NARC, players have an arsenal of weapons to use as well as down-and-dirty hand-to-hand fighting skills.
