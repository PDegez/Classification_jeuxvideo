The Postal Dude (Corey Cruise) escapes from Paradise after it was nuked by him and arrives at a town called Catharsis. Without any means of getting out of town, he begins to do several odd jobs around the town for multiple people, including Ron Jeremy, the Postal Babe, infamous movie directer Uwe Boll, his uncle Dave, and Osama Bin Laden, eventually either dying and going to hell, becoming the president and nuking the world, or escaping Catharsis and meeting a car thief who winds up becoming his girlfriend.
