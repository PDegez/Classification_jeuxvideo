POSTAL 2: Corkscrew RuLes. is a licensed addon for POSTAL 2 that was developed by Avalon Style Entertainment and published by Akella. Storywise, it has nothing to do with the base game, existing as a Russian adaptation of POSTAL 2. The game stars a man known as Shtopor (more commonly known as "Corkscrew", who looks very much like the Postal Dude) who wakes up in a hospital to find that someone has stolen his penis. Journey through Muhosransk City on a journey to find your stolen sex organ and kill the bastard responsible.
