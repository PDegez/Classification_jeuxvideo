But the assignment turns deadly when the principal is found murdered, and the M.O. points to the Joker. The two women join forces with police officer Katsuya Suou and mysterious wiretapper Baofu to track down the source of the Joker curse. But will this really end the insanity in Sumaru City? Does the mysterious deja vu felt by the citizens of Sumaru have some deeper meaning? And who is the mysterious boy that Maya's certain she's seen somewhere before...?
