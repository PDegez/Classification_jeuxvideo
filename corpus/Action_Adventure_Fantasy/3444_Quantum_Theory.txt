It has been 300 years since humanity collapsed in the wake of a great war. Nearly all of civilization destroyed, only small groups continue to live on in the wasteland. However, in the wasteland, there are strange towers that have appeared. Seemingly sentient, nobody knows who built them or why, only that anyone who ventures near will know only death. From these towers comes a mysterious substance called diablosis, which corrupts those who touch it, turning them into murderous killing machines. One man, known only as Syd, has made it his mission to destroy these towers and stop the diablosis.
