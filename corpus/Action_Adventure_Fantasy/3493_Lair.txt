Lair is an action, flight, and combat game in which players control the reins of a dragon to fight both in air and land. The player controls a knight in a secret society known as "The Burners", all of whom fly dragons in combat. While it is unknown whether or not you are able to dismount your dragon and fight as just the knight, Factor 5 said that they hope for you to get off the dragon in certain areas and be able to get back on. It is known, however, that you are controlling the dragon through him.
