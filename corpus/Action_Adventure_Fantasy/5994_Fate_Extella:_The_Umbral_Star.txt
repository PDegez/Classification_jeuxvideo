The events of this title follow those of Fate/Extra, in which the world of SE.RA.PH is controlled by the all-powerful lunar super-computer known as the Moon Cell Automaton. In the digital realm of SE.RA.PH, the Holy Grail War is over, but the land's new ruler faces challenges and threats from all sides. Those Servants who survived the war now find themselves drawing up tense and unlikely alliances, preparing for a conflict that may tear SE.RA.PH apart...or destroy it entirely.
