Players will play as Erina, who focuses on close quarters combat. Ribbon the fairy is the ranged attacker who follows Erina's lead, indirectly controlled by the player. Erina may be a little rabbit that was turned into a human, but that doesn't stop her from being capable of some pretty neat moves. Both Erina and Ribbon's abilities can be improved by learning new skills and attacks through collecting items and upgrades that are spread throughout the world. What trinkets and skills to pick up is up to the player; dare you challenge hard mode without any items?
