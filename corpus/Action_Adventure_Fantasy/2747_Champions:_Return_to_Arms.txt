In this sequel to Champions of Norrath, the fate of Norrath is once again in your hands. Dark forces are trying to resurrect Innoruuk, the God of Hatred, and the choice is yours either to stop them or to turn to the dark side and aid in his resurrection. Once again, choose from either a wood elf ranger, a high elf cleric, a dark elf shadowknight, a barbarian warrior, or an erudite wizard, or from the new Vah Shir Berserker and Iksar Shaman classes. Create a new character or import your character from the first game, then begin a solo campaign or play with up to three friends.
