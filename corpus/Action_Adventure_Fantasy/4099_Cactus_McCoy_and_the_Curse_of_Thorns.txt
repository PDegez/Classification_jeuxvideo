When a routine treasure hunt goes awry, McCoy is transformed into a walking cactus by the ancient Curse of Thorns. McCoy's mission is to return the Thorned Emerald to its true home. If he fails, the curse will continue until he is a lifeless, stone cactus. This latest game throws you into a Wild West world filled with ruthless outlaws, mysterious curses, and more treasures than you can swing a stick at. Run, jump, and punch your way through an army of Enemigos sent by the monstrous Hex Hatfield. Throughout 12 expansive and dangerous areas, you will find and master a barrage of weapons from razor-sharp machetes to giant bazookas. As you travel, you will uncover missing map pieces that will guide you to the source of the curse. Along the way, you can hunt for treasure, compete in time trials, take on unique challenges, or unlock over 80 badges. Master the art of "Enemigo Juggling" to steal weapons and money from the villainous outlaws, and use those spoils to upgrade your many different fighting stats.
