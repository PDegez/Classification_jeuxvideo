On her death bed, Scotia, witch of the Dark Army, bestowed her evil twisted powers upon her son, Luther- but there were complications... Now Luther uncontrollably shape-shifts (from human to lizard to beast). While on a quest searching for answers to his 'problem,' Luther ventures to many different lands, including a Haunted Monastery, the Huline Village, the Dracoid Cemetery, old Runes, Hive Caves, a Citadel infested with Ruloi, and the City of the Ancients. With Bacatta on his tail, who believes Luther is just as evil as his mother was, Luther must avoid being arrested, attempt join the Wild One tribe, put a deadly Larkhorne to sleep, and venture through the ever large Huline Jungle (while solving many mysteries along the way). While Luther is on his quest, Dawn of Gladstone is on one of her own. There have been many unexplainable happenings in and around Gladstone, so Dawn is directed by the Draracle to the Southern Continent to find answers. After bumping into Luther and showing no sign of hatred towards him, Dawn offers him a spell to help dampen his inconsistent morphing until he can find a cure. But Luther discovers some other things, such as the plan of one of the Ancient gods- to resurrect himself from death and force rule over the kingdoms. Now Luther must battle two very different forces of evil- one within and one without. There are FOUR endings to the game, and you can prove your innocence by being 'good,' or you can follow the foot steps of your mother and prove Bacatta right.
