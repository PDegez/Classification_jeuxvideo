Junkyard is a grim wasteland, a realm of eternal rain and eternal battle. Its inhabitants are divided into six tribes that constantly fight each other, each trying to become the champion, earning a passage to the promised land Nirvana. Serph is the leader of the Embryon, a small tribe based in the Muladhara region of Junkyard. One day, the Embryon and their rivals, the Vanguards, find a strange pod, which both believe to be a weapon placed by the other tribe. During the fight, the pod opens, and as a result Serph and his lieutenants transform into demons, literally devouring the Vanguards. The pod disappears, and in its place Serph finds a mysterious, yet strangely familiar black-haired girl, who remembers nothing about herself. Serph and his friends try to find out who or what sent her into Junkyard, what is the meaning of their demonic transformation, and, ultimately, who they truly are and how they ended up in that desolate place. Meanwhile, the battle for survival continues, and soon only one tribe will retain the hope of leaving the Junkyard forever.
