An outlander arrives on Enderal in search of a second chance in life. The outlander soon gets pulled into the turmoil the continent suffers at the moment. The Red Madness is devouring the lands, turning everyone affected into mindless animals searching for flesh. The outlander soon discovers his/her ability to see a glimpse of the past, witnessing the end of a previous civilization on Enderal. He/she gets dragged into working for the Holy Order, a religious organization that has ruled over Enderal since the presumed death of the Light-Born. They assume that the outlander is a prophet who is the only hope to prevent the end of the world.
