Gauntlet Dark Legacy is about a wizard named Garm who used the thirteen runestones to summon a demon named Skorne. This demon, instead of obeying the wizard, killed him and banished him to the underworld. He then released his minions upon the land and scattered the runestones across the eight realms so that they would never again be used against him. "No one has dare try... Until now." -Gauntlet opening 2001
