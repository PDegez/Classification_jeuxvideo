God has never had it so rough. Meet Renya, who happened to become God through a lottery. And then, his self-proclaimed personal angel named Lilliel took him to Celestia right away. Together, they will tackle countless randomly-generated dungeons in this story-driven rogue-like RPG in order to guide the fate of all mankind to a revolution. Fight, grow strong, customize your appearance, strengthen your equipment, and then fight some more. The only limit to your strength is your imagination.
