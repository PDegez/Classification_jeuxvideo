It's time again for the four warriors to gear up and head out on a new quest. Their mission this time is to retrieve the Sacred Orb of Rendar that was stolen by the nefarious Morak. He has hidden the Orb along with many other treasures in his Five Worlds maze. He of course has his many minions guarding his ill gotten riches.
