Cowboy is a gun fighting game with a Western setting bearing thematic similarities to Shoot Out for the 1292 Advanced Programmable Video Game System. The players control a cowboy on the screen and must try to hit each other with their pistol fire. The cowboys fire their bullets in horizontal lines and can hide behind objects for protection. The first player to have 30 hits on the opponent wins the game. Game variations allow for different sizes for the cowboys, different backgrounds, invisible cowboys, and different firing distances and guided shots (during their path bullets can be moved up or down). A limited shot game limits the guns to 10 bullets, with guns being reloaded once both players shot all their bullets.
