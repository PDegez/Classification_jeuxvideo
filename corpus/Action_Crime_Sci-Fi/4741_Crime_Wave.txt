A massive crime syndicate has taken over our major cities, turning them into deadly criminal wastelands, with murder, arson, drugs, and extortion, all under the control of a mysterious man by the name of King Pin. Suddenly, it reaches the ears of a noble former policeman named Lucas McCabe, who hears that these mobsters have suddenly kidnapped President Cole's daughter Brittany. It is up to you, Lucas McCabe, to rescue his daughter and stop the drug lords before it is too late. You are armed with the highest weaponry and assault technology ever made, such as machine guns, ball-blaster guns, and rocket launchers. You rush through these cities and fight the criminals to save the President's daughter (and the whole country).
