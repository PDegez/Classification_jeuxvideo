It's the end of summer and it's up to your fairy to help Tinker Bell and her friends find rare seeds to create the rainbow lily, which will be used for the end of the summer celebration. In order to create the rainbow lily, you must gather 6 different seeds that can only be found by using the clues from a riddle given to you by the Minister of Summer. The six different flowers make up the color of the rainbow. You and each of Tinker Bell's friends must go to various areas to discover clues to the seeds locations. You get clues by playing mini games that are tasks set up by other fairies who are working to get summer ready. The mini games are specific to a fairy's talent. So, if your avatar fairy isn't the right talent, you'll play as one of Tinker Bell's friends.
