In the distant future, Earth is suddenly threatened by a mysterious phenomenon which revolves around weapons malfunctioning at military facilities around the world. The cause of these mysterious incidents are crystals who have the ability to use the weapons against humanity. This is referred to as "Crystal contamination". As a result of these incidents, an elite military organization known as "V.C.D.", or Vanguard for Crystal Destruction, is formed. The V.C.D. is armed with a series of fighter planes known as the Fighting Thunders, and most of them are present at the V.C.D.'s command ship, the Bellwether, with Richard Maxwell as acting captain of the ship. The player is one of those Fighting Thunders, referred to as "Raiden" by Richard Maxwell, and their mission is to defeat the crystals and the contaminated weapons across the planet.
