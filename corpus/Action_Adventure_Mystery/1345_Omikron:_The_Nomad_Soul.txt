Omikron is a massive city-state in which the people are ruled blindly by an ancient supercomputer and a communist dictator with an iron fist who carries out the computer's orders. Little do the people of Omikron know that a demon lord from the last circle of Hell is the true power behind their land's governance. The Nomad Soul, a foretold hero, enters Omikron through his computer and becomes trapped in this parallel realm. Desperate to escape back to his own world, and to help new-found friends fight the dark forces guiding Omikron, the Nomad Soul does what he must to liberate Omikron for ever.
