The latest title in the acclaimed 'Empires' series is here, bringing together the fast-paced action of the Warriors series and territorial expansion strategy. A new, intuitive system of political management, in which the best officers can be simply placed in their most effective positions, makes its first appearance, while cooperative battles are powered up. Additional focus on historical episodes and the interplay between characters also serve to create a heightened sense of drama. 'Genesis Mode,' in which you can create your very own Warring States era, allows you more individual customization than ever before.
