Dr. Robotnik had successfully managed to get his hands on six of the Chaos Emeralds without Sonic knowing about it. Unfortunately for him, an accident during the testing phase of one of his new weapons had scattered the six emeralds. He managed to recover the yellow emerald, but failed to track down the other five. As he predicted, Sonic and his buddy Tails are now out to retrieve them, so he once again tricks Knuckles into working for him. Meanwhile, a treasure hunter named Nack the Weasel had eavesdropped on the conversation between Sonic and Knuckles. Unknown to them, Nack had already discovered the Chaos Emeralds in his home dimension. Now Sonic and Tails must fend off Robotnik and Knuckles while retrieving the emeralds back from Nack.
