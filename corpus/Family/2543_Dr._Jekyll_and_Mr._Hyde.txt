A mild-mannered doctor (Jekyll) with a monstrous alter-ego (Hyde) must navigate through the streets of London where they are constantly accosted by well-dressed thugs, defecating crows, randomly placed bombs, and other assorted hazards. The player primarily controls Dr. Jekyll, but if the doctor suffers too much damage he transforms into his villainous counterpart and is sent to a Hellish, monster-infested alternate reality. The ultimate goal is to reach the church where his lover, Miss Millicent, is waiting to marry him.
