Monster Hunter Generations is the second installment in the fourth generation of the series. This is the most customizable Monster Hunter experience to date, and it serves as a fitting tribute to the last decade of the series with a blend of brand new areas and monsters, and returning fan-favorites that have been updated and adapted to the newest generation of game-play.
