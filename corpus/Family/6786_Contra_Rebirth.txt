The year is 2633. The Neo-Salamander Force, led by Chief Salamander, has traveled back to 1973 to wipe out the Contra Force, at the time when Earth's defenses were still primitive. They set up a base in the ruins of the Shizuoka temple at the Yucatan Peninsula located in Central America. Two members of the Contra team, Bill Rizer and samurai Genbei "Jaguar" Yagyu, along with the female android Brownie and the alien Pliskin, are deployed back in time to stop the Neo-Salamander Force.
