Asterix: Search for Dogmatix is a Game Boy Color-exclusive title based on the Asterix license. The story is simple: Obelix's dog Dogmatix is missing, and Obelix decides the Romans may have kidnapped him. The gameplay is largely identical to Infogrames' previous titles Asterix and Asterix and Obelix, although the order of levels is no longer linear and minigames have been introduced to each set of levels to break up the action.
