Gameplay is similar to the Tony Hawk's series in which players skate around each level performing various tricks, using either characters from Toy Story, Tarzan and The Lion King, or with a created human skater. There are three main modes: Adventure, Free Play and Versus. In Adventure mode, the skaters indigenous to their own world compete in skate challenges. They are restricted to their worlds. The human skater can move in and out of any world. In free play, the skater can skate in any world they are indigenous to but not compete in the challenges. The human skater can continue to skate in any world. Two players can play any skater in any world and compete in a series of skate games.
