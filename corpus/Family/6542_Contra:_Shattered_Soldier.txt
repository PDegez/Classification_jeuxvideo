In 2642, Earth remains scarred from alien conflicts and 80% of the world's population was devastated by a malfunctioning hyper-magnetic weapons grid during development. Bill Rizer, the hero of the Alien Wars, was held responsible for the incident, as well as murdering his partner Lance Bean, who had reportedly tried to stop him. Bill was sentenced to 10,000 years in cryogenic prison. But five years later, 2647, Earth is suddenly threatened by a terrorist organization called Blood Falcon, led by a mysterious commander. The Triumvirate, the ruling government, releases Bill prior to completing his sentence. A female soldier and cyborg, Lucia, has been assigned to become Bill Rizer's partner for his mission.
