Disney's Kim Possible: What's the Switch? is a Kim Possible video game for the PlayStation 2, released in North America on October 19, 2006, in Europe on November 17, 2006, and in Australia on February 15, 2007. It is the first and only Kim Possible video game to appear on a home console, as all the other games were designed for hand-held systems. It is also the first to feature voice acting, all the actors voice their characters. Both Kim and Shego are playable characters. In each stage, control is relayed between the two of them as they chase Professor Dementor and Monkey Fist around the world. Rufus is also playable at certain points in the game, but only when playing with Kim.
