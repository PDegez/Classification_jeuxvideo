Wario's thrown a temper tantrum while playing his Game Boy Advance, and gone and broken it. He heads off to the manic Dr. Crygor's lab to get him to fix it. But what happens instead is that hundreds of Game Boy-like systems are created, with no buttons and an addictive tilt control. Wario's gonna be even richer than ever before when he sells this.
