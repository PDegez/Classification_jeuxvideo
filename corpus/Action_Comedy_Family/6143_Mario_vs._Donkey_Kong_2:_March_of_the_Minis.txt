A "Super Mini-Mario World" amusement park opens, based on the mechanical toys produced by the Mini-Mario Toy Company. Mario offers a Mini-Mario toy to Pauline, while Donkey Kong offers her Mini-Donkey Kong toy. Pauline chooses Mario's toy over that of Donkey Kong. An insulted Donkey Kong then kidnaps Pauline. Mario is unable to follow them, but sends the Mini-Mario toys to rescue the damsel-in-distress.
