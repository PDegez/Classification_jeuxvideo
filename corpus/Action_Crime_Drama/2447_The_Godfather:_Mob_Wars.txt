The Godfather: Mob Wars is a game designed specifically for the PlayStation Portable. The game offers a traditional strategy game approach for gamers who want to become a part of the Corleone family. Maneuver your mobsters and play the right cards (gameplay uses cards and boards, as seen in traditional strategy games) to take control of NYC one territory at a time. Once things heat up, drop down on the streets to start knocking heads around and claiming territory.
