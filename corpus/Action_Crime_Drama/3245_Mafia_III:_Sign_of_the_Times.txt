Haunted by the murder of his surrogate family, Lincoln joins Father James at Sammy's to find closure. But on their arrival, they collide with a deranged cult using sites of suffering and loss for human sacrifices and ritualistic horrors. With all-new vehicles, weapons, and investigative tools, Lincoln plunges deep into this dark world of drugs and violence to end the cult's reign of terror and just maybe find his own kind of peace.
