A man (was Brandon Heat before he was known as Beyond the Grave) was betrayed and killed by Harry McDowell. Dr. T later found and revived him into a killer without a soul. Meanwhile, a girl named Mika Asagi brought the heavy luggage full of weapons to Dr. T's office told by her mother who was Grave's former love interest. Armed with two pistols called Cerberus and a coffin full of armaments, Beyond the Grave must put an end to The Syndicate and Harry McDowell (the man who killed him long time ago) as well. Will he succeed?
