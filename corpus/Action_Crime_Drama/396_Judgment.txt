We have followed Kazuma Kiryu through his journey to solve mysteries, save a little girl and protect an orphanage through the Yakuza series. Judge Eyes is set in the Yakuza universe in a fictional depiction of Kabukicho and we now follow a detective that has had a shady past through his own story in this universe. Instead of seeing things on the Yakuza side, we see things in the eyes of the law.
