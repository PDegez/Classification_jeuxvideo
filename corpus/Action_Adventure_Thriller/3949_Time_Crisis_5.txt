Three months ago, a VSSE auditor carrying a silver briefcase that contains information about a traitor within the VSSE has been murdered, and the case was stolen by Wild Dog. Next generation VSSE agents Luke O'Neil and Marc Godart are sent to retrieve the case, with Robert Baxter being Luke and Marc's superior officer for the mission. With Catherine Ricci serving as the agents' air support, will they be able to retrieve the case, defeat Wild Dog, and expose the traitor within the VSSE?
