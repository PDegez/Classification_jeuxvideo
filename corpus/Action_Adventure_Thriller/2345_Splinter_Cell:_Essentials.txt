Arrested by the agency he's served for so long. Now Sam Fisher is taken into custody and interrogated on a murder he may or may not of committed. During jail time, Sam recalls past events during his Navy and Third Echelon Days. All of those are playable as missions. Travel back to 1992, where Fisher is still a Navy Seal set on a mission to save Douglas Shetland(who was at that time a commanding officer). And revisit the past events in the Splinter Cell series. Sam must search in his memories on who is the one who framed him.
