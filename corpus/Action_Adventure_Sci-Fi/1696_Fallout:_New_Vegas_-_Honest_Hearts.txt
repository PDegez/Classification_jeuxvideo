The story leads the protagonist to the Canyon of Zion where he stumbles into a war between three tribes: the White Legs want to assimilate the Sorrows so they can join the Legion; the Dead Horses are allied with the Sorrows, but the two spiritual leaders have different opinions how to proceed: Joshua Graham, previously a high-ranking member of the Legion, wants to attack and Daniel, a New Canaanite (Mormon), prefers an evacuation.
