'Splosion Man is captured by Big Science. As the scientists celebrate, a bottle of liquid is spilled onto some electrical wiring causing a surge of energy to flow to an experimentation platform where a yellow bow is falling. The bow touches the platform, the surge of energy is released, and Ms. Splosion Man is born. She escapes Big Science's facilities and heads out into the world.
