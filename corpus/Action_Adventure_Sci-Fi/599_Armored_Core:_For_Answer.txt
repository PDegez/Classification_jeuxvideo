Ten years after the National Dismantlement War, the planet has become extremely polluted and is falling apart at the seams. "The League", a organization of corporations, have decided to build the "Cradle System" high above the Earth in order to protect civilians, but the system running the habitats only make things worse down below on the surface. Using these platforms, they run the planet below using a high-tech army to dominate and control. Hearing of this, a group of surface dwellers form the rebel group called "The Line Ark" attack the "The League" in an attempt to bring order out of chaos. In this another mysterious faction called the "ORCA" has surfaced, their motives unknown to both sides.
