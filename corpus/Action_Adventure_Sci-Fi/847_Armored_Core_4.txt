The game is set in a dystopia on Earth, where corporations have conquered the world's governing bodies amidst increasing civil unrest and dwindling resources, and established a new world order named the Pax Economica, forcing citizens to live in oppressively-ruled colonies. Eventually the member corporations of the Pax Economica begin warring with one another. The player character is a freelancer pilot from the civilian colony of Anatolia who takes jobs from different companies, and eventually seeks the colony of Line Ark, where corporate bodies are not able to rule.
