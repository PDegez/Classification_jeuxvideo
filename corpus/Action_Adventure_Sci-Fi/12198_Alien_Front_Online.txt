Alien Front Online is a tank driving shoot-'em up that focuses on online play. The premise is a classic alien invasion of earth. Non-friendly aliens descend to the earth and put up strongholds around globe. You can choose to fight the resulting battles from the side of the army or the side of the aliens. Every faction has three vehicles (small, medium and large) with different armor and speed. In online mode, this game supports 4 player vs. 4 player battles. A special catch is the usage of the Dreamcast microphone which allows you to speak either with all players or only your own team. In single player mode, there are 30 missions for each side. You move from mission to mission in a branching storyline with multiple endings. Additionally there is an arcade mode in which the goal is to kill all aliens in a limited time.
