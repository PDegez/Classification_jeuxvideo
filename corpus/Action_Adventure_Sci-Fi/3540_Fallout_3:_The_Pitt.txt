The fifth and final downloadable expansion for Fallout 3, Mothership Zeta begins with the player picking up a strange radio transmission from the Wastes. The signal leads to a crashed alien scout ship that can be discovered in the regular game - only this time, you won't be allowed to leave. An alien beam pulls the player into the orbiting mothership, where they must band together with abductees from different periods of Earth history to escape.
