(Story) After being pulled into the Bermuda Triangle,pilots Will & Ava end up in an unknown & mysterious parallel world known as "The Void". While trying to find a way out,they encounter a hostile & advanced alien race known as "The Watchers",a mysterious tribe that worships the watchers as gods & an alliance of resistance fighters that are also, looking for a way out of "The Void"! (Gameplay) The gameplay is an Action/Adventure third-person shooter. The game starts off as a standard on-foot,action-shooter,but then switches it up by introducing a jet-pack not long afterwards. From there on,the gameplay seamlessly transitions from on-foot shooter to vertical based combat to high speed aerial dogfighting with enemy fighters. The down side to the combat is that there are very few weapons to choose from,but as you progress through the game,you earn tokens that can be used to level up the few guns that you do obtain.
