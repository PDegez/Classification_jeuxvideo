You are a security officer aboard the interstellar colony ship Marathon, which brought a slice of humanity to the planet of Tau Ceti. Docking with the craft, you realize quickly that the ship is under attack by an alien race called the Pfhor. If that wasn't bad enough, it seems that Durandal, one of the Marathon AIs, has gone 'rampant'. You're not really sure if that means he's insane, or just malfunctioning, but you have a colony to save.
