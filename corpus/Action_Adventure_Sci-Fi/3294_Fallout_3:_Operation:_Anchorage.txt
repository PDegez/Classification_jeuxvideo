This expansion adds four to five hours of war-action stealth gameplay and is presented as an in-game virtual reality simulation set in the fictitious city of Anchorage in Alaska. After downloading the content, it appears as a new quest through a radio broadcast. When entering the simulation, the player is stripped off all equipment and weapons, having to resort to supplies in the environment. It deals with the Brotherhood of Steel outcasts who want to infiltrate one of the Vaults to get rare pre-war technology. But to pass the security system, the infiltrator should break through the virtual training game, set in Anchorage and representing the defense against the Chinese Communist forces. The player assumes the role of the infiltrator.
