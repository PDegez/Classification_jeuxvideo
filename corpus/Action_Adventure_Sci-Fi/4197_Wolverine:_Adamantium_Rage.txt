Designed for Sega Genesis, this version of "Wolverine: Adamantium Rage" is a side-scrolling platformer/beat'em up which is, similar to, but different from the version released on the SNES. After receiving a mysterious photograph, Wolverine goes on a journey in which he must battle his way through the Weapon X lab, the frozen landscape of Dead Man's Land, the Canadian forests, a lunar dreamscape, and New York's Hellfire Club and sewers. In addition to various robots/enemies, Wolverine must defeat Albert, Lurker, Lady Deathstrike, Sabertooth, Cyber, Bloodscream, and Trevor Fitzroy. However, if he takes to long on a level, Elsie-Dee will find him blow both of them up, costing him one of his 5 lives.
