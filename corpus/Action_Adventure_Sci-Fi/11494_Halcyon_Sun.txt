The game tells the story of Dru Avery, a squadron commander that leads a group of fighter in the last days of a space war set between a coalition of the Eridani race and the Carolan Commonwealth (the latter of which Avery is a member), and the Nolledah Revolutionary Republic. The story also contains more drama-like elements such as complex relationships. For instance, Avery's girlfriend is the Eridani liaison officer on the Carolan base ship and this leads to trouble as the relationship between the two factions in the coalition deteriorates due to rivalry. The story is furthered through lengthy, rendered cut-scenes including cliffhangers and credit sequences that can take up up to twenty minutes for a portion.
