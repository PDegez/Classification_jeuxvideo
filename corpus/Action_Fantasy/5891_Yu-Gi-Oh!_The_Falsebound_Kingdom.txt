Yugi and his friends are trapped in a virtual reality world gone crazy. As Yugi or Kaiba, you must form a team of three monsters to occupy towns across two different scenarios and take part in strategic team battles. Delegate commands to your team to conquer each mission. During battle, your team can perform devastating group attacks and combos. Over 175 monsters from the Yu-Gi-Oh! animated TV series appear in the game--and all of them will fight to the finish for control of each map.
