With the world at peace, the nine senshi challenge each other from supremacy. The player chooses one of the five Inner Senshi, the four Outer Senshi or Chibiusa. The fighting takes place in various scenes in Tokyo, with the player required to beat the senshi opponent two times out of three. The camera zooms in and out, depending on how far the opponents are from each other. The player can use special control combinations to invoke the senshi's special powers. After beating the other eight senshi, the player must defeat Super Sailor Moon to claim the title of Super Senshi.
