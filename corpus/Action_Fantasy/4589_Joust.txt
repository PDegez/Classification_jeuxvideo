As a joust wielding yellow armored knight riding a flying ostrich. You must navigate through a series of floating rock platforms above molten hot lava. With a berserk of enemy knights, many of them riding buzzards who want you for dead. In order to survive, you must use your joust to kill the enemies without getting killed first whether it be by an enemy or accidentally falling into the lava.
