Hugo's arch-enemy, the evil Scylla has returned and this time has found a way to make herself the most powerful witch of all time and take over the entire world. For this, she requires a magic potion to be made from extremely rare black diamonds which are to be found only on the jungle island where the Kikurians live. She takes them all prisoner and forces them to work day and night in search of black diamonds. The elder King Kikurian asks Hugo the troll to liberate them and stop Scylla's plot. When Fernando arrives a letter from King Kikurian,who is imprisoned in a cell and unable to help his people, he has no time to waste as he must free all the slaves and destroy the diamond potion factory to stop Scylla's plot before it is too late.
