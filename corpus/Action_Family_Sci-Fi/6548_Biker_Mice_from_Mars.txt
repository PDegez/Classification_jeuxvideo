After their home planet of Mars is annihilated by the Plutarkians, three renegade mice, Throttle, Vinnie, and Modo, high tail it for Earth and the safety of Chicago. But they soon find out that Limburger, the Plutarkian Leader has chosen Earth as his next target. Now you're in a race against time and the Plutarkians to save the planet while also showing off your riding skills. The name of the game is motorcycle racing, and there are three different modes to choose from: Practice, Main Race, and Battle Race. As you burn rubber through the streets of Chicago, you'll have to be on the lookout for the evil Plutarkians that are on your tail. Not to worry, though, because your bike is outfitted with weapons that will clear a path for you. If you're feeling particularly diabolical, you can also play as the bad guys and try to send the mice to the Big Cheese in the Sky.
