Deep within an experimental underground facility, humans are imprisoned as test subjects and trained to become soldiers. Equipped with armored battle suits, the subjects must fight for survival and eliminate each other to determine who will become the Ultimate Human Weapon. As Bomberman, your objective is simple: destroy your opponents before they destroy you. Survive through 99 stages as you try to escape to the surface. Scramble for hidden items including speed, bomb, and armor power ups. Evade looming bomb blasts from a new tension-filled perspective. Choose from the classic one-hit, one-kill gameplay style, or utilize a new life bar and item system for a more aggressive gameplay style. Earn multiple achievements in single and multi-player modes to increase your Gamer Score. Up to 8 players can engage in frantic battles for survival online through Xbox Live and earn points to become the ultimate weapon on the World Rankings.
