SENS VR is the first virtual reality game inspired by a graphic novel. You play a man lost in a maze of strange laws. What is he looking for? Where are you going? To complete this initiatory journey, you must use both your observational skills and your imagination. You will follow various types of arrows, which are either obvious or hidden in graphic illusions. Surprised by an illusion, swept along by a storm, flying above infinite towns, you will be able to lose yourself and then find your way easily, but not without questions.
