1942 - the Germans have lost the battle for control over the Atlantic. The once feared Grey Wolves are on the run and the German WWII U-boat fleet is suffering heavy losses. In 'Das Boot VR Demise' you are trained to command a German World War II submarine on the mission to intercept and sink enemy freighters to interrupt the supply line of the allied forces. This unique interactive VR experience is based on the successful 2018 TV series 'Das Boot' and the legendary original 'Das Boot' movie. Will you be successful on the hunt and save your sailors and the U-boat from sinking to the deep and unforgiving sea? Immerse yourself as the captain and steer the fully interactive WWII U-boat silently through hostile waters. Use the periscope to search for your targets and enemy warships. Dive deeper and switch to silent running when allied ships are closing in. Close the valves to avoid water breaking in and keep a cool head when depth charges hit the hull. Relive the most intense moment of the legendary 'Das Boot' and experience the tension of naval warfare under the sea in this 8- 10 minute single-player experience.
