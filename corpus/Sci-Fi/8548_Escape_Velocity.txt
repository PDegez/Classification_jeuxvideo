The player is thrown into the middle of a galactic civil war in the twenty-third century, where the Confederation which saved humanity from its war with hostile aliens is now threatened from within by a growing Rebellion, which claims the Confederation has oppressed its people. The player can join either side, or go it their own way as a mercenary, merchant, or space pirate.
