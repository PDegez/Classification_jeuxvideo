In this sequel to 2006's "Megaman ZX", the player can choose between two characters: Grey, a mysterious Reploid boy suffering from amnesia, trying to find out who (and what) he really is, or Ashe, a spunky girl who dreams of finding treasure and carving out a legacy of her own. They get more than they bargain for when they discover Biometal Model A, a powerful artifact that allows them to transform into a super-powered being; a Mega Man. Now, sucked in by a conspiracy to decide which one of these Mega Men will rule the world, they set off to stop it's imminent destruction on behalf of the world government, Legion, and discover who they really are... and perhaps, all there is to know about the world!
