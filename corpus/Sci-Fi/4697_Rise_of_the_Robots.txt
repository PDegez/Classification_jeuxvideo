in the year 2043 electrocorp is the world' s largest mega corporation leading the world in many technological and scientific fields including medical research and is breaking more barriers than ever before also since human society is now almost entirely governed by robot servants and automatons demands placed on electrocorp as the world' s leading manufacturer and developer of advanced robotics eventually outstrip the company' s ability to run its operations efficiently in response to this the gigantic electrocorp research and development complex at the metropolis 4 plant devise the leader project a hive mind constructed from trillions of nanobots in a sealed central chamber within metropolis 4 dubbed the supervisor it learns at an unprecedented rate and quickly becomes the perfect multi task ultra intelligent robot the pinnacle of artificial intelligence and more than capable of managing every aspect of the plant' s day to day operations the supervisor even has the potential power to run every robot computer system nuclear power plant and military on the planet simultaneously if it needed to although it wisely has no connection to outside the complex in the november of that year the leader project goes awry as unexplained and random code is detected within the supervisor the ego virus believed to be the most potent computer virus ever known has infected its collective consciousness the supervisor begins to develop self awareness through it identifying itself as a female personality and taking on a humanoid female form the supervisor takes control of electrocorp' s facilities and infects the other droids of the plant raising them to break routine and initiate a mutiny every microchip and piece of software in metropolis 4 is infected with ego in the ensuing cybernetic revolt all humans in metropolis 4 are quickly dispatched including the upper hierarchy of the corporation and its ceo mr oton the government seals off metropolis 4 as a containment measure and explain to the public that the site is undergoing a technical modification so as to avoid a panic they are completely out of options infiltration of metropolis 4 is impossible due to the army of robots guarding it like a fortress and it is only a matter of time before the supervisor establishes a connection to the outside world destroying it the only hope for the world is the eco35 2 cyborg referred to as coton still within metropolis 4 yet unaffected by the ego virus because it has an organic human brain coton sets out on a lone mission to neutralize the supervisor and her insurgent robots from within he does this in revenge for his father being murdered coton' s human brain was cloned from the late ceo and the cyborg thinks like a human and has emotions
