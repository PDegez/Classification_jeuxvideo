in the year 2043 electrocorp be the world ' s large mega corporation lead the world in many technological and scientific field include medical research and be break more barrier than ever before also since human society be now almost entirely govern by robot servant and automaton demand place on electrocorp as the world ' s lead manufacturer and developer of advanced robotic eventually outstrip the company ' s ability to run its operation efficiently in response to this the gigantic electrocorp research and development complex at the metropolis 4 plant devise the leader project a hive mind construct from trillion of nanobot in a sealed central chamber within metropolis 4 dub the supervisor it learn at an unprecedented rate and quickly become the perfect multi task ultra intelligent robot the pinnacle of artificial intelligence and more than capable of manage every aspect of the plant ' s day to day operation the supervisor even have the potential power to run every robot computer system nuclear power plant and military on the planet simultaneously if it need to although it wisely have no connection to outside the complex in the november of that year the leader project go awry as unexplained and random code be detect within the supervisor the ego virus believe to be the most potent computer virus ever know have infect its collective consciousness the supervisor begin to develop self awareness through it identify itself as a female personality and take on a humanoid female form the supervisor take control of electrocorp ' s facility and infect the other droid of the plant raise they to break routine and initiate a mutiny every microchip and piece of software in metropolis 4 be infect with ego in the ensue cybernetic revolt all human in metropolis 4 be quickly dispatch include the upper hierarchy of the corporation and its ceo mr oton the government seal off metropolis 4 as a containment measure and explain to the public that the site be undergo a technical modification so as to avoid a panic they be completely out of option infiltration of metropolis 4 be impossible due to the army of robot guard it like a fortress and it be only a matter of time before the supervisor establish a connection to the outside world destroy it the only hope for the world be the eco35 2 cyborg refer to as coton still within metropolis 4 yet unaffected by the ego virus because it have an organic human brain coton set out on a lone mission to neutralize the supervisor and her insurgent robot from within he do this in revenge for his father be murder coton ' s human brain be clone from the late ceo and the cyborg think like a human and have emotion
