In Darkest of Days, players travel back and forth through the annals time to relive some mankind's most dire hours, when human society was at its lowest points. By fighting through terrible events such as The Battle of Antietam, the bloodiest conflict of the Civil War, and the volcanic eruption in Pompeii in the year 79, the player attempts to save certain key individuals who were never meant to become involved in these truly monstrous events and thereby change human history for the better.
