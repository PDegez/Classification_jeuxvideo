As a freelance mercenary, Bolt Logan has been to some tough planets and had some tough jobs. In fact, one year ago his partner betrayed him and alerted the soldiers to take care of him. But Logan survived with the aid of another person, and worked hard to rebuild his credit supply. Now, a year after that incident, the freelancer has a new ship, new implants, a new partner and is looking for some new jobs. It's a good time too - since the corporations and individuals of the galaxy are all in a virtual gold rush looking for the rare terraforming compound, Chrome.
