Happy Wars is a free-to-play, class-based action RPG game where the player can participate in 15-on-15 battles involving other players and/or bots in fantasy worlds with the goal of storming their enemies' castle and knock down their tower. To do this, the other team must either break through the castle gate with siege weapons or use ladders to ascend the walls and breach the castle. Once in they have to tear down the Big Tower to emerge victorious. Each team's castle however has defense weapons such as explosives, cannons and ballistas to ward off attackers.
