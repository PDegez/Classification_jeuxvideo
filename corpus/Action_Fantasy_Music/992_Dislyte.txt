The Miracles blinked into existence across the world, after which their destructive Miramon streamed outwards to wreak havoc. Certain individuals somehow attuned to the sonic emanations from the Miracles developed new powers, becoming Espers capable of battling effectively against Miramon. These Espers rose up to shield humanity from the Miramon and restore order in humanity's darkest hour.
